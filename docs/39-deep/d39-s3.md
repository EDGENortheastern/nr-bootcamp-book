# D39S3. NLP

Natural Language Processing, or NLP for short, is broadly defined as the automatic manipulation of natural language, like speech and text, by software.

The study of natural language processing has been around for more than 50 years and grew out of the field of linguistics with the rise of computers.

Let us find out more about NLP [here](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-natural-language-processing-in-python/simple-topic-identification?ex=1)

## TF-IDF

TF-IDF stands for "Term Frequency â€” Inverse Document Frequency." This is a technique to quantify words in a set of documents. We generally compute a score for each word to signify its importance in the document and corpus. This method is a widely used technique in Information Retrieval and Text Mining.

If I give you a sentence for example:

```text
"This building is so tall."
```

It is easy for us to understand the sentence as we know the semantics of the words and the sentence. But how can any program (e.g., in Python) the interpretation of this sentence? It is easier for any programming language to understand textual data in the form of numerical value. So, for this reason, we need to vectorize (turn into numbers) all of the text so that it is better represented.

By vectorizing the documents we can further perform multiple tasks such as finding the relevant documents, ranking, clustering, etc. This exact technique is used when you perform a Google search (now they are updated to newer transformer techniques). The web pages are called documents and the search text with which you search is called a query. The search engine maintains a fixed representation of all the documents. When you search with a query, the search engine will find the relevance of the query with all of the documents, ranks them in the order of relevance and shows you the top k documents. All of this process is done using the vectorized form of query and documents.

# D39S1. Deep learning

## Deep learning vs machine learning

First of all, deep learning **is** machine learning. More specifically, deep learning is considered an evolution of machine learning.

Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence that includes algorithms that parse data, learn from that data, and then apply what has been learned to make informed decisions.

Deep learning is a type of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the human brain cells.

Deep learning relies on a layered structure of algorithms called an artificial neural network. Deep learning has huge data needs but requires little human intervention to function.

## Neural networks

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are comprised of a node layers, containing an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.

[Hear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJNHXPs0XDk) Steve Brunton explain why neural networks are called neural networks.

There are many... many [types of neural networks](https://www.asimovinstitute.org/neural-network-zoo/).

## TensorFlow and Keras

### TensorFlow

[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is an open-source end-to-end framework for building Machine Learning apps.

Google makes it. AlphaGo Zero,a version of the AlphaGo software, was trained using TensorFlow, with 64 GPU workers and 19 CPU parameter servers.

TensorFlow is a symbolic math toolkit that performs a variety of tasks including deep neural network training. It enables programmers to construct machine learning applications by utilizing a variety of tools, frameworks, and community resources.

Googleâ€™s TensorFlow is now the most well-known deep learning package on the planet. Machine learning is used by Google in all of its products to enhance search, translation, picture captions, and recommendations.

### Keras

[Keras](https://keras.io/) is an open-source software library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks. Keras acts as an interface for the TensorFlow.

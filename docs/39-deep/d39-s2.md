# D39S2. Multilayer Neural Networks

## Shallow Neural Networks

When we hear the name Neural Network, we feel that it consist of many and many hidden layers but there is a type of neural network with a few numbers of hidden layers. Shallow neural networks consist of only 1 (or 2) hidden layers. Understanding a shallow neural network gives us an insight into what exactly is going on inside a deep neural network.

In Keras, to make a shallow neural network:

```python
ann.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=6, activation='relu'))
```

## Hyperparameters

In machine learning, a hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is used to control the learning process.

Hyperparameters are the variables which determines the network structure(Eg: Number of Hidden Units) and the variables which determine how the network is trained(Eg: Learning Rate). Hyperparameters are set before training(before optimizing the weights and bias).

Artificial neural networks have two main hyperparameters that control the architecture or topology of the network: the number of layers and the number of nodes in each hidden layer.

Hyperparameters to [Dense](https://keras.io/api/layers/core_layers/dense/) layer in Keras also include an Activation Function

## Activation Function

We know that a neural network is basically a set of mathematical equations and weights. To make the network robust, so that it performs well in different scenarios, we leverage [activations functions](https://keras.io/api/layers/activations/).

`activation='relu'` (in the code bloack above) is a linear rectifier activation function. It is less **computationally expensive** than tanh and sigmoid because it involves simpler mathematical operations.

## Multilayer Neural Networks

Although many different models of neural networks have been proposed, multilayer neural networks are the most common.

These networks consist of many interconnected identical simple processing units, also called neurons. Each node calculates the dot product of the
incoming signals with its weights, adds the bias to the resultant, and passes the calculated sum through its activation function. In a multilayer network the neurons
are organized into layers with no feedback connections.

Multilayer neural networks are models that chain many neurons in order to create a neural architecture. Individually, neurons are very basic units, but when organized together, we can create a model significantly more powerful than the individual neurons.

In Keras, to make a deep neural network:

```python
ann.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=6, activation='relu'))
ann.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=6, activation='relu'))
```

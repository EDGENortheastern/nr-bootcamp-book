# D5S2. Data visualization

## Types of data

> In data analytics, the term "data types" does not mean integers, strings, etc.

Different types of variables require different types of statistical and visualization approaches.

Therefore, to be able to classify the data you are working with is key.

We can classify data in two main ways based on its type and on its measurement level.Therefore, to be able to classify the data you are working with is key.

We can classify data in two main ways based on its type and on its measurement level.

## Categorical and numerical data

Categorical data refers to a data type that can be stored and identified based on the names or labels given to them.

Numerical data refers to the data that is in the form of numbers, and not in any language or descriptive form.

One example of categorical data is car brands like Mercedes, BMW and Audi.

Another example of categorical data is colour: yellow, red.

Numerical data, on the other hand, as its name suggests, represents numbers, e.g., height.

It is further divided into two subsets, discrete and continuous.

## Discrete and continuous data

Discrete data can usually be counted in a finite matter.

A good example would be the number of children that you want to have, even if you don't know exactly how many, you do know you want a positive integer number of children.

It's easier to understand discrete data by saying it's the opposite of continuous data, continuous data is infinite and impossible to count.

For instance, your weight can take on every value in some range. That is continuous data.

Other continuous measurements are height, area, distance and time.

## Levels of measurement

Data can be split into two groups: qualitative and quantitative.

Qualitative data can be **nominal** or **ordinal**.

Nominal variables are like the categories we talked about just now ‚Äì Mercedes, BMW or Audi, or like the four seasons ‚Äì winter, spring, summer and autumn. They aren‚Äôt numbers and cannot be ordered.

Ordinal data, on the other hand, consists of groups and categories which follow a strict order.

Imagine you have been asked to rate your lunch and the options are: disgusting, unappetizing, neutral, tasty, and delicious.

Although we have words and not numbers, it is obvious that these preferences are ordered.

Thus, the level of measurement is qualitative, ordinal.

Quantitative variables are also split into two groups: **interval** and **ratio**.

Intervals and ratios are both represented by numbers but have one major difference.

Ratios have a true zero and intervals don‚Äôt. Most things we observe in the real world are ratio.

## Choose the right plot

To succeed in data visualization, you need to choose [the right plot](https://www.data-to-viz.com/) and tools.

## Choose the right tool

Python has many data visualization packages. [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is one of the most used libraries among them. It has a range of plots that you can quickly build and customize.

Some of the most frequently used plots include:

- [a line plot](#line-plot)
- [a scatter plot](#scatter-plot)
- [a histogram](#histogram)
- a bar chart
- a pie chart

## Line plot

A line plot shows every data value along a number line that displays the range of the data. Unlike [a scatter plot](#scatter-plot), a line plot also connects all data points with a line and, as a result, is not always meaningful.

## Scatter plot

Scatter plots allow visualizing unordered data points. They are great for showing relationships between variables and data patterns.

## Histogram

A histogram looks like a bar chart but shows the frequency of the data and distribution of values.

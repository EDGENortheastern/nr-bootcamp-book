# D40S3. Pull requests and code reviews

A Pull Request is an event that takes place when a contributor is ready to begin the process of merging new code changes with the main project repository.

So far, you have pushed changes to your codebase straight into your main/master branch.

In real life, this rarely occurs.

Some of the key features of GitHub are options to collaborate and code review.

Pull Requests allow you to collaborate with your colleagues or supervisors to improve your code.

## PRs for README files

Step 1. Create a new repository. Initialise it with a README.

Step 2. Edit the README (click on the pencil icon and write in Markdown).

Step 3. Scroll all the way down to the README page. Instead of pushing to Main/Master make a branch:

<img
  src="/img/last-day/branch.png"
  alt="Branch"
  class="wide screenshot"
/>

Step 4. Open a Pull Request:

<img
  src="/img/last-day/make-pr.png"
  alt="Make PR"
  class="wide screenshot"
/>

Step 5. Merge the Pull Request.

Optional steps: try adding Katia, Alex or anyone else from your cohort to your repo. Make more PRs and get other people give you code reviews.

## PRs from Deepnotes

To make a Pull Request from your code (assuming we are all using Deepnote), before doing `git add .` create a branch from a terminal like so:

```bash
git checkout -b my-new-branch
```

The follow the usual steps for psuhing code to GitHub:

Step 1. Add your Python to staging on git:

```bash
git add .
```

Step 2. Commit your Python to git, e.g.,:

```bash
git commit -m "Adds the chart"
```

Step 3. Git push or something like:

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin master
```

Step 4. Log in with your GitHub. You may need to first set up an Access token on GitHub. Go to Settings, find the section Developer Settings and follow the steps.

When you have pushed a branch to GitHub you will see the option to make a Pull Request and to get someone to review.

Let us practice branching and pull requests.

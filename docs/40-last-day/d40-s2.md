# D40S2. Spam identifier mini-project

## Build your own spam identifier

Use a Kaggle data set to build your own spam identifier.

I recommend [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chandramoulinaidu/spam-classification-for-basic-nlp) data set.

Use your knowledge from the [NLP Data Camp](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-natural-language-processing-in-python/regular-expressions-word-tokenization?ex=1) to explore spam and ham data.

Use your data viz skills to explore spam and ham data further.

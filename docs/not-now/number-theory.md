## Decimal numbers and before

We have ten digits because we have ten fingers 🙌. If a mathematician came up with a base number, it would probably be 12 as it has more factors.

**The ancient Babylonians** introduced a base-60 number system. It is called the sexagesimal system. We still use it 🕗.

**The Romans** loved number 🖐 and had a special symbol for it: V.

15 in Roman was XV.

6 was VI.

Then **the Arabic numerals** were invented and the world loved them. Here is how they work.

| Thousands | Hundreds | Tens | Units |
| :- | :- | -: | :-: |
| 6  | 3  | 2  | 1   |
| * <var>10<sup>3</sup></var>| * <var>10<sup>2</sup></var>| * <var>10<sup>1</sup></var> | * <var>10<sup>0</sup></var> |

<span class="emphasis">6*1000+3*100+2*10+1 = 6321</span>

## Binary numbers

Computers use binary numbers with only two digits: 0 and 1. That is because electricity can be only **on** or **off**.

Here is how binary numbers work.

| * <var>2<sup>3</sup></var>| * <var>2<sup>2</sup></var>| * <var>2<sup>1</sup></var> | * <var>2<sup>0</sup></var> |
| :- | :- | -: | :-: |
| 0  | 1  | 0  | 1   |

<span class="emphasis">0*8+1*4+0*2+1*1 = 5</span>

## Other number systems

As you have probably figured out, the base number is arbitrary. Onec can deicide to have a 22-digit number system and make up some characters to represent each digit.

Some of the commonly used number systems are:

1. octal
2. hexadecimal

## Converting between number systems

In Python, you can convert a decimal number to a binary number this way:

```python
dec_num = 4
bin(dec_num)
```

>The [`bin()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bin) function returns a string containing some information about the number system. The code above will return `'0b100'`

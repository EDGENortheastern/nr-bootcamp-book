# D36S3. Data Model Construction

## Machine Learning models

A machine learning model is **an expression of an algorithm** that analyses data, finds patterns or makes predictions. Fueled by data, machine learning models are the mathematical engines of artificial intelligence.

For example, an ML model for computer vision might be able to identify cars and pedestrians in a real-time video. One for natural language processing might translate words and sentences.

Under the hood, a machine learning model is a mathematical representation of objects and their relationships to each other. The objects can be anything from "likes" on a social networking post to molecules in a lab experiment.

## Building an ML model

When we are building a machine learning model we usually take standard steps.

- problem formulation
- data tidying
- preprocessing
- train-test-split
- model building
- model validation and fine-tuning
- prediction

It starts with problem formulation. Then we do data tidying, then data preprocessing, then we split the data between test data and training
data, then we build the model and train it.

Once we get the results, we validate the results and measure accuracy. We may fine-tune the model. we will consider model fine-tuning when we look at classification tasks.

And lastly, we use the model for prediction and other purposes.

## Deepnote - build your own regression model in Python

Below is a link to a `.csv` file. It is the Boston house prices data set I borrowed from the Data Camp. Upload it into a Deepnote and make an appropriate data model.

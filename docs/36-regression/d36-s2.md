# D36S2. Mulitvariate OLS Regression

So, simple linear regression is a straightforward approach for predicting y on the basis of a single predictor variable X. However, it is possible not only try to predict y based on many features but have various outcomes, not just y.

## Multiple regression

Multiple regression is a regression that takes more than one variable into
account, more than one feature. The concept is pretty simple.

It answers the question: what if we have more than one variable influencing the thing that we are trying to predict?

So for an example, we might be predicting the price of a car based on its many features. The car has a lot of different things you can measure that might influence its price, e.g., mileage, age, how many cylinders it has, how many doors it has, etc.

## Mulitvariate Regression

Now, as often is the case in data science, there is some confusing terminology here in addition to multiple regression, which is using multiple features to predict a single value.

We also have the concept of multivariate regression, and you would think that would mean the same thing. But it doesn't.
Typically, when we talk about multivariate regression, we're talking about not only having multiple features that we're trying to use to make a prediction, but we're also trying to predict more than one thing at the same time.

# D36S1. Univariate OLS Regression

If you have been doing [Supervised Learning with scikit-learn](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/supervised-learning-with-scikit-learn) then you already know that there are two classic tasks in supervised machine learning:

- classification
- regression

From the statistics week, you may also remember that regression is a statistical method used in finance, investing, and other disciplines.

It attempts to determine the strength and the nature of the relationship between one dependent variable and one or more of the other variables.

## Regression analysis

Regression is a technique for investigating the relationship between the [independent variable(s) or features](#features) and a dependent variable(s) or [target](#target).

It is used as a method for predictive modeling in machine learning, in which an algorithm is used to predict continuous outcomes.

Solving regression problems is one of the most common applications for machine learning models, especially in supervised machine learning. Algorithms are trained to understand the relationship between independent variables and an outcome or dependent variable. The model can then be leveraged to predict the outcome of new and unseen input data or to fill a gap in missing data.

## Features

Features or independent variables are different terms for the same thing. "Feature" is more common in Machine Learning, whereas "independent variable" is more common in statistics.

Some more mostly equivalent terms are "covariate", "predictor", and "regression input."

Independent variables are the inputs for a process that is being analyzed.
Dependent variables are the output of the process.

For example, in the iris data set, the independent variables are sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. The result, the species of an Iris is the dependent variable.

## Target

The target variable (also called the dependent variable) used in the analysis for this tutorial is a categorical variable that differentiates clinicians in the study that indicated that they would be Highly Likely to Use Product X from those that had a Low Likelihood to Use the new product.

For example, in the iris data set, the dependent variable or target is the species of an Iris.

## Types of regression models

Some types of Regression Analysis techniques are:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Polynomial Regression

## Univariate Linear Regression

Linear regression is one of the most basic types of regression in machine learning. The linear regression model consists of a predictor variable and a dependent variable related linearly to each other. This means that the line of best fit is a line.

In case the data involves more than one independent variable, then linear regression is called multiple linear regression models. We will consider it in the next session.

Simple linear regression that is also known as univariate linear regression is a regression model that estimates the relationship between one independent variable and one dependent variable using a straight line.

The equation to denote the linear regression model:

```text
y=a+b*x
```

where `y` is the dependent variable;

`a` is the intercept, the point where the line crosses the y-axis, the value of y when x = 0;

`b` is the coefficient or the slope;

`x` is the independent variable;

## OLS

There are different ways to find the slope and the y-intercept to plot the best fit line on your scatter plot (or in your data set).

At school Science students just eyeball it.

In fact, there are a few different methods to draw the line of best fit. One of most common is the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method.

So, what is "the line of best fit?" It simply means that a line best reflects the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. If you are using the OLS method, it does so by minimising the squared distances from each point on a scatterplot to the line of best fit.

And that is Univariate OLS Regression model.

## Data types and Pandas

A Pandas Series is a one-dimensional data structure.

The difference between a Series and a list is the fact that Series can have indexes (numeric) or keys (strings) as data labels. The Pandas Series data type is built on top of the NumPy array. We can turn a list into Series.

```python
rates = [20, 30, 50, 40]
rates_into_Series = pd.Series(rates)
rates_into_Series
```

You can also make Pandas Series from tuples and some dictionaries.

You can combine multiple Series into a data frame:

```python
df = pd.DataFrame(columns = ['Names', 'Rates']) # you need to name columns this way

df['Names'] = series_1
df['Rates'] = series_2
df # weee - we made a dataframe from scratch
```

We can make also make data frames from dictionaries when values are lists:

```python
new_dict = {"Fruits": ["apple", "banana", "tomato"], "Amount":[3,5,6]}
```

## Functions

It is important to know Pandas methods such as `.max()`. However, when you know how to write your own functions, you can be data analyst without that knowledge.

The one extra information about Pandas that you need is a method called `.apply()`.

```python
def multiply(val):
    return val*3
```

The function above multiplies by three.
We can send it as a parameter to a data frame method `.apply()`, e.g.,:

```python
df2['Amount'].apply(multiply)
```

The code above multiplies every value in the column `Amount` of the data frame df2 by 3.

The code block above does not change the data frame df2. We need to either overwrite df['Amount'] or assign all values to a new column, e.g.,:

```python
df2['New Amount'] = df2['Amount'].apply(multiply)
df2 # prints the data frame df2
```

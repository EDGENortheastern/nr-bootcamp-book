# D11S1. Computational Thinking

Computational thinking is a set of skills that enable people solve complex problems.

Computational problem-solving always starts with data as the input.
The output is not only a solution to a problem but a process for arriving at it. Computational thinking makes sure the process can be replicated and others can reuse it.

Computational thinking is based on four main ideas:

1. Decomposition - breaking the problem down into smaller, more manageable parts

2. Pattern Recognition -analyzing data and identifying similarities and connections among its different parts

3. Abstraction - identifying the most relevant information needed to solve the problem. removing extra details

4. Algorithmic Thinking - developing a step-by-step process to solve the problem so that the work is replicable by humans or/and computers

Algorithmic Thinking is tightly linked with programming paradigms, traditional styles, or ways of programming. 

## Programming paradigms

A non-exhaustive list of contemporary programming paradigms is below:

- Imperative: Programming with an explicit sequence of commands.
- Procedural: imperative with function calls.
- Declarative: Programming by specifying the result a user wants, instead of how to get it.
- Functional: Programming with function calls that avoid any global state.
- Object-Oriented: Programming by defining objects that send messages to each other.
- Event-Driven: Programming with emitters and listeners of asynchronous actions.

This week we are looking at programming, mostly in Python. We will consider imperative, procedural, declarative, OOP, and functional programming.

However, we already know a lot about declarative vs imperative/procedural. Let's sum up.

## Imperative/procedural programming

Pure Python (also known as Python standard library) is often used in an imperative or procedural way.

For example, we can find out the maximum value in a data frame column 'Space Flights' of the astronauts data set in this (imperative) way:

```python
max_val = 0
for i, j in df[['Space Flights']].iterrows():
    print(j.values)
    if j.values[0] > max_val:
        max_val = j.values[0]
```

`.iterrows()` is a Pandas version of a for loop, it allows to iterate through a data frame.

The code uses a classic algorithm for finding a maximum value. Here is the same algorithm used for a list:

```python
my_list = [2,3,47,11,23,567,45,3] # defines a Python list
max_val = 0 # define a vairable for maximum value
for num in my_list: # iterate through list
    if num>max_val: # compare the variable with the current array value
        max_val=num # overwrite the maximum value with the current value in a list
print(max_val)
```

> The difference between procedural and imperative coding is the use of functions. Nowadays you can call this way of coding either.

## Deepnote for algorithms

Duplicate the Deepnote below, run or re-run the cells and try the tasks (signposted üèãÔ∏è).

## SQL

So, is SQL language imperative or declarative?

Here is a SQL codeblock (for the BigQuery public data set):

```sql
SELECT
  SUM(number) AS num_people
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_current`;
```

To help you decide if SQL is procedural or declarative try the following tasks:

- Extend the query above to sum numbers of people for each name
- Only group and sum female names
- Sort the results with the most common names first
- Only show names that were used by over one million people
- Only get the top 5 most common American female names

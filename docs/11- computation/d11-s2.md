# D11S2. Programming in SQL and Python

You can combine using SQL and Python. This way web developers build backend and database communications. Data analysts who know Python can query databases this way.

To start using SQLite via Python you must:
```python
import sqlite3
```

The database connection is a standard way of communicating with a database via a non-SQL programming language:
```python
db_connection = sqlite3.connect('./chinook.sqlite')
```

After creating the connection, we create a cursor. The cursor is going to interact with the database for us.
```python
cursor = db_connection.cursor()
```

We can then execute a query using the execute function.
```python
results = cursor.execute("select * from Album")
```

Note that if there are multiple results, we will have to loop through them as below.
```python
for row in results:
    print(row)
 ```
 
 We can do more complicated things, such as putting a variable or piece of data into queries.
 The fetchone() will return only a single value.
 ```python
cur.execute("select * from album where artistId = (?)",[245]).fetchone()
```


We can also get multiple results using fetchall()
Note that this is returned as a list of tuples. A tuple is like a list, but it can't be changed.
```
cur.execute("select * from album where artistId > (?)",[270]).fetchall()
```

A tuple doesn't have any description of the information, it's just the values themselves.
Often we want to know what the information actually is.
We can turn on the row machine, that makes a row object resembling a dictionary. 
We will explore dictionaries later, but effectively they're like a folder for storing data
e.g. ```python{'key1':value1,'key2':value2}```.
The key tells us what the value is a measurement of - what the column heading would be.

```python
con_with_rows = sqlite3.connect('./chinook.sqlite')
con_with_rows.row_factory = sqlite3.Row
cur = con_with_rows.cursor()
row = cur.execute("select * from album where artistId = (?)",[245]).fetchone()
row.keys()
```
Will produce a list of all the column headings e.g. 
```python
['AlbumId', 'Title', 'ArtistId']
```
We can also turn it into a dictionary:
```python
dict(row)
```
Will produce a dictionary with the information.
```python
{'AlbumId': 310, 'Title': 'Prokofiev: Romeo & Juliet', 'ArtistId': 245}
```
Dictionaries can be more easily transformed into pandas dataframes.

# D3S4.  Programming challenges and projects, day 3

## Individual or group project

Make a GitHub Pandas project that explores top 10 movies.

You can use [imdb data sets](https://www.imdb.com/).

The [data sets](https://datasets.imdbws.com/) are explained [here](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/).

IMDB have their own [leaderboard](https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/). However, they are not explaining how exactly they set up their ranking, e.g., how they have identified "regular" imdb users. You can do better.

You may also use one of the "cleaner" movie data sets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com), e.g., [this one](https://www.kaggle.com/harshitshankhdhar/imdb-dataset-of-top-1000-movies-and-tv-shows).

Finally, you can use the .csv file from the "Introduction to Pandas" lesson.

Projects will be demoed on Friday. Make sure they are on GitHub.

# D3S1. NumPy Arrays

## NumPy

[NumPy](https://numpy.org/) NumPy stands for Numerical Python; it is a scientific computing package. It is mostly used for array computing, however, it also has many advanced mathematical functions.

The Data Science convention prescribes importing NumPy as so:

```python
import numpy as np
```

NumPy methods can then be used as so:

```python
rand_num = np.random.randint(0,10) #generates a random integer
```

## `np.array()`

**NumPy Array** is one of the key data structures for Data Analysts. It:

- is more efficient than a list (faster, more Pythonic, and has less memory footprint)
- homogenous
- allows operating on a set of values at one time (vectorized arithmetic operations)
- allows masking and filtering on a set of values without using loops or filter### Definition



## Vector arithmetics

If a plus sign is used on two lists, they get concatenated.

Data Analysts often need to operate on all values in a data set. To make it easier, NumPy arrays allow performing vectorised arithmetics, e.g., operations on all values in arrays.

## Boolean NumPy arrays

Boolean NumPy arrays work as masks. They allow one-line filtering of array values. Pandas data frames are filtered in a similar way.

# D26S3. Pandas Queries

## Filtering data

In Python, there are many ways to select specific rows from a Pandas dataframe.
The easiest is to use the following subsetting notation:

```python
human_resources = df[df['Team']=="Human Resources"]
```

The code above selects only people who work in Human Resources and reassigns to a new data frame, `human_resources`.

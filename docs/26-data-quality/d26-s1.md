# D26S1. Data Quality Management

Data Quality Management is the management of people, processes, technology, and data within an organization, intending to improve the metrics of data quality, e.g., data quality dimensions. To succeed in data quality management a partnership between the business and technology group is essential.

## Stages of data quality management

**Plan stage:** The data quality team assesses the scope of known issues involving determining the cost and impact of the issues and evaluating
alternatives for addressing them.

**Deploy stage:** Profile the data and institute inspections and monitors to identify data issues when they occur. During this stage, the data quality team can arrange for fixing flawed processes that are the root cause of data errors, or as a last resort, correct errors during data cleansing.

**Monitoring stage:** It is for actively monitoring the quality of data as measured against the defined business rules. If the data quality falls below the acceptable threshold, data stewards are notified so they can take action during the next stage.

**Act stage:** This stage is for taking action to address and resolve the
emergency data quality issues.

## Data quality

Data quality is one of the most critical issues in data management. Real-life data are often dirty: inconsistent, duplicated, inaccurate, incomplete, or stale. Dirty data generates misleading or biased analytical results. This can lead to loss of revenues, credibility, and customers. With this comes the need for data quality management.

## Measuring data quality

Data quality can be difficult to assess. Every organization is unique and should use its own data quality metrics. For example, patient data in healthcare must be accurate, up-to-date, and available when required. On the other hand, customer data needs to be unique, accurate, and consistent across transactional and support systems. Data quality dimensions help capture the critical data attributes specific to the context of an organization.

## Data quality dimensions

A data quality dimension is a term describing a quality metric that can relate to multiple data elements. Data quality dimensions allow comparing data quality levels across different systems or tables, attributes, records, or more abstract groupings such as business units or product ranges.

There is no universal definitive list of data quality dimensions. However,  many data analysts recognize the importance of the following six dimensions:

- [Accuracy](#accuracy)
- [Completeness](#completeness)
- [Uniqueness](#uniqueness)
- [Timeliness](#timeliness)
- [Validity](#validity)
- [Consistency](#consistency)

The scores of data quality dimensions are usually expressed in percentages. For example, when you use patient data with 87% accuracy for billing, 13% of the data cannot guarantee you correct billing.
It has been reported that about 47% of recently created data records have at least one critical error. High-quality data is the exception, with over 97% acceptability score.

### Accuracy

The accuracy of data ensures that real-world entities associated with data entries can participate as planned. An accurate phone number of a customer, for example, guarantees that they are reachable. Measuring data accuracy requires verification with authentic references, e.g., birth certificates, and passports. You can verify the accuracy of some details with testing, e.g., customer bank details by processing a transaction.

### Completeness

Data is considered “complete” when it fulfills expectations. This dimension can cover several attributes and depends on the data entity. For example, if the customer address entity includes attributes such as house name, data can be considered complete even when this information is missing, providing the customer can be reached. A customer’s middle name can be omitted, but as long as you have the first and last name, the data is complete.

However, there should be no significant gaps or missing information for the data to be truly complete. That is why most data analysis tools have features that allow looking for missing values.

### Uniqueness

This dimension indicates there are duplicated records in the data set.
Duplicate values can be diagnosed when we have the same information repeated across multiple rows. Duplicate values can be caused by human errors during data entry or because of bugs and design errors. However, this issue most frequently arises from the necessary act of joining and consolidating data from various resources. Numerous data analysis tools allow deduplicating data. Some can be used when data sets are joined and others during the data cleansing stage.

### Timeliness

Timeliness can be measured as the time between when information is needed and when it is available. If you need financial information every quarter and the data is ready when it is supposed to be, the data is timely. The data quality dimension of timeliness is linked with the user expectation. If your information isn’t ready exactly when you need it, it doesn’t fulfill that dimension. It is more down to the operations than the data team to improve timliness.

### Validity

Data validity is the degree to which data values are consistent. A data set is considered valid if its values follow the same format for each column. A popular example is birthdays. Many systems will ask you to enter your birthday in a specific format, and if you don’t, it is invalid. On data entry, validity can be enforced with form validation. However, when diverse data sets are merged it is possible to lose data validity, e.g., if some dates are entered in the British and others in the American way.

### Consistency

In many organizations, the same data may be stored in more than one table, system, or column. If that information matches, the data is "consistent." For example, if your human resources information systems say an employee does not work there anymore, yet your payroll says they are still receiving a check, that is inconsistent data.

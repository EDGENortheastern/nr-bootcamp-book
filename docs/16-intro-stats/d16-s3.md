# D16S3. Stats in Pandas

## Percentiles

The most common definition of a percentile is a number where a certain percentage of scores fall below that number.

For example, the 20th percentile is the value (or score) below which 20% of the observations may be found.

You might know that you scored 67 out of 90 on a test. It might even give you a grade. However, it does not tell you what percentile you fall into, i.e., how do you compare to your classmates.

If, on the other hand, you know that your score is in the 90th percentile, that means you scored better than 90% of people who took the test.

A nice property of percentiles is that they are universal. Being at the 95th percentile means the same thing no matter if you are looking at SATs exam scores or GCSEs or codewars.

They also allows you to fairly compare two data sets that have different means and standard deviations.

# D16S1. Introduction to Statistics

## Statistics

Statistics is the study of organizing, summarizing, and describing quantifiable data and methods of interpreting this data.

There are two main types of Statistics:

1. Descriptive statistics
2. Inferential statistics

Descriptive statistics summarizes, organizes and often visualizes characteristics of a data set. A data set is a collection of observations from either a sample or the entire population.

Inferential statistics allows converting observations on samples to conclusions about populations.

The word statistics has two common meanings. Firstly, it refers to a collection of quantitative information about a data set, e.g., means, medians of columns, etc.

Secondly, it may refer to drawing inferences about large groups (populations) based on observations made on smaller ones (samples).

## Populations, parameters, samples, and statistics

In statistics, **a population** is the pool of individuals, creatures, or objects grouped by a common feature.

A population does not have to be very large, although statistical procedures assume extremely large or infinite populations.

> In stats, a population is defined as "an **entire** distribution of similar observations or events." ([from Data Camp](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-statistics-in-spreadsheets))

**Parameters** measures and describe population characteristics.

A sample is a subset of a population.

## The first steps in data analysis

The first step in data analysis is unquestionably data collection.

The next step is data cleaning, however, to clean our data we first must explore the data set. This is where obtaining descriptive statistics and initial data visualizations play an important role.

You have probably noticed that Pandas data frames come with histograms. That is because the insight from a histogram is instant.

Different types of statistical variables require different types of statistical and visualization approaches. Therefore, classifying the data you are working with is a vital step.

## Types of data - recap

> In data analytics, the term "data types" does not mean integers, strings, etc.

We can classify data in two main ways based on its type and its measurement level.

By type, data can be either categorical or numerical. Numerical data can be either discrete or continuous.

By levels of measurement data can be split into qualitative and quantitative.

Qualitative data can be:

- nominal
- ordinal.

Quantitative data can be:

- interval
- ratio.

Let us revise those types some more.

## Categorical and numerical data

Categorical data is based on the names or labels given to values.
One example of categorical data is car brands like Mercedes, BMW and Audi. Another example of categorical data is color: yellow, red.

Numerical data refers to the data in the form of numbers, e.g., height, weight, count. Numerical data is further divided into two subsets: discrete and continuous.

## Discrete and continuous data

Discrete data can be counted. An example is the number of children you want to have, even if you don't know exactly how many, you do know you want a positive integer number of children, a countable number. In our IMDB example, it was the number of votes.

It's easier to understand continuous data as opposite of discrete, continuous data is infinite and impossible to count. For instance, your weight can take on every value in some range. That is continuous data. Other continuous measurements are height, area, distance and time.

## Levels of measurement

Data can be split into two groups: qualitative and quantitative.

Qualitative data can be **nominal** or **ordinal**.

Nominal variables are categories, e.g., colors. They arenâ€™t numbers and cannot be ordered.

Ordinal data, on the other hand, consists of groups and categories which follow an order and can be sorted.

Imagine you have been asked to rate your lunch and the options are: disgusting, unappetizing, neutral, tasty, and delicious.

Although we have words and not numbers, it is obvious that these preferences are ordered.

Thus, the level of measurement is qualitative, ordinal.

Quantitative variables are also split into two groups: **interval** and **ratio**.

Intervals and ratios are both represented by numbers but have one major difference.

Ratios have a true zero and intervals do not. Most things we observe in the real world are ratio.

## Visualising categorical data

To visualize data you should know its type and measurement level. To choose [the right plot](https://www.data-to-viz.com/), for example, you can use this online tool:

Let us first explore different graphs and tables needed to visually represent categorical data.

Some of the most common ways to visualize them are frequency distribution tables, bar charts, and pie charts.

A frequency distribution table has two columns, the category itself and the corresponding frequency. Imagine you own a car shop and you sell only German cars. The table below shows the categories of cars Audi, BMW, and Mercedes and their frequency, e.g., the number of units sold.

| Product Name | Frequency |
| :- | -: |
| Mercedes | 400 |
| Audi  | 3,500  |
| BMW  | 1,900 |

By organizing your data in this way, you can compare the different brands and see that Audi has been sold the most.
So that is a frequency distribution table.
Using a frequency table we can construct a bar chart also known
as a column chart. The vertical axis shows the number of units sold while each bar represents a different category indicated on the horizontal axis.

To represent the same data as a pie chart we need to calculate what
percentage of the total each brand represents. In Statistics, this is known as relative frequency. All relative frequencies must add up to 100 percent if you want a pie chart. A pie chart can only be used to show fractions of a whole.

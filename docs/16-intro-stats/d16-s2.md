# D16S2. Introduction to spreadsheets

Spreadsheets allow obtaining a number of descriptive statistics for numerical data very easily.

Some of he most common statistics for numerical data inlcude:

- [Mean](#mean)
- [Mode](#mode)
- [Median](#median)
- [Standard Deviation](#standard-deviation)
- [Variance](#variance)

The three measures of central tendency are mean, median and mode. A measure of central tendency is **a single value** that attempts to describe a set of data by identifying the central position within that set of data.

## Mean

One of the most common summative statistical measures for numerical data is the mean. In Google Sheets, it is called `AVERAGE(),` which is a terrible name, as it is only one of the averages. Mean is calculated by adding the values and dividing the total by the number of values.

The mean is the most common measure of central tendency, but it
has a huge downside – it is easily affected by outliers.

Imagine, you have the prices of pizza at 10 different locations in New York City and 10 different locations in LA. For the mean in NYC, we get 11 dollars, whereas for LA - just 5.5! On average, pizza in New York can’t be twice as expensive as in LA, right? Correct. The problem is that in our sample, we have included one posh place in New York, where they charge 66 dollars for pizza, and this doubled the mean.

## Median

Median helps to overcome the problem with outliers.

You find median by putting the numeric values in order from the smallest to largest and figuring out the middle value.

To calculate Median in Google sheets (for column B not counting the title) you can use:

```text
=MEDIAN(B2:B)
```

## Mode

Mode is the value, which appears most often in the set. To find the mode, you need to count how many times each value appears.

The mode is easy to understand and calculate. The mode is not affected by extreme values. The mode is useful for qualitative and quantitative data.

To calculate mode in Google Sheets you can use:

```vb
=MODE.SNGL(A1:A10)
```

## Variance

The variance measures data's dispersion from the mean.

It is computed by finding the difference between every data point and the mean, squaring them, summing them up, and then averaging.

The benefits of squaring to calculate the variance include:

- Squaring always gives a non-negative value, so the sum will always be zero or higher.
- Squaring emphasizes larger differences, a feature that turns out to be both good and bad (think of the effect outliers have).

Both Variance and Standard Deviation are measures of spread.

In Google Sheets you can calculate the variance of a sample as:

```text
=VAR(B2:B)
```

In Google Sheets you can calculate the variance of a population as:

```text
=VARP(B2:B)
```

## Standard Deviation

The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.

```text
=STDEV(B2:B)
```

# D13S1. Functions in Python

To sum up a part of Monday's session: the difference between imperial and procedural coding is the existence of functions. An old school name for some types of functions is "procedures." Functions are also sometimes called subroutines.

A function is a block of code that is written under a name, an identifier. The code inside a function will **not run** unless a function is called.

A function is called by its name. The function is defined with the keyword def. Let us exemplify.

```python
def subtract_nums(num_1, num_2):
    return num_1 - num_2
```

Above is the definition of the function subtract_nums. `num_1` and `num_2` are parameters of the function. There are no errors in the function definition, however, it will not run until:

```python
print(subtract_nums(50, 5)) # calls function subtract_nums with parameters 50 and 5.
```

You can assign the result of a function call to a variable:

```python
difference = subtract_nums(100, 10)
print(difference)
```

You can use variables as parameters:

```python
def subtract_nums(num_1, num_2):
    return num_1 - num_2

first_num = -2 # creates a variable, assigns a value to it
second_num = 190 # creates a variable, assigns a value to it

print(subtract_nums(first_num, second_num)) # uses variables as parameters
```

## Functions and tests

One of the advantages of using functions is the fact that we can test functions.
Automated testing means that we can make software that would run functions for us with certain parameters and compare expected and actual output. That is how codewars works.

Normally, tests are written as separate files. For example, if we write the function body in a file `subtract.py`:

```python
def subtract_nums(num_1, num_2):
    return num_1 - num_2
```

we can test this function with the following test, also written in its own file:

```python
import pytest #imports testing framework

from subtraction import subtract_nums #imports funtion

def test_subtract_nums():
    assert subtract_nums(10,5) == 5

```

To start using a ttesting framework you need to import pytest:

```bash
pip3 install pytest
```

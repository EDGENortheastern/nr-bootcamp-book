# D14S1. Functional programming

Functional programming has been around for a very long time (60 years or more).

Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which the primary method of computation is using pure functions.

A pure function is a function whose output uses only input values, without any side effect.

To understand side effects it is important to understand local and global variables.

## Global variables

Variables that are created outside of a function are global variables. Let us consider the following code:

```python
my_global = "Hello"

def myfunc():
  print(my_global,", Python") # this function returns nothing - it is a procedure

myfunc()
```

The code above will work and will not produce any errors.
However, global variables can cause serious bug, for example:

```python
my_global = "Hello"
def myfunc2():
  my_global = my_global + ", Python"
  print(my_global)

myfunc2()
```

The function above is trying to change a global variable. Python is a functional language, so it stops the coder from writing such code and hte code will break.

To fix the bug shown above you can code like that:

```python
def myfunc3():
  global my_global
  my_global = my_global + ", Python"
  print(my_global)

myfunc3()
```

To illustrate more side effects let us look at Python lists as globals.

```python
my_list = ["Katia", "Alex", "Grace", "Aba", "Jacob"]

def myfunc4():
  global my_list
  my_list.sort()
  print(my_list)

myfunc4()
print(my_list)
```

The `sort()` function is mutating the list (changes the original list). So, the function actually changes the global variable and other functions will get its new value even if they need the old one.

## Local variables

A local variable is a variable that is only accessible within a specific part of a program, e.g., inside the function. Local variables are defined within that function.

Local variables cannot be used by other functions. However, they allow to eliminate bugs. For a value to be passed from one function to another coders use parameter passing.

Let us look at a local variable example:

```python
my_list = ["Katia", "Alex", "Grace", "Aba", "Jacob"]

def myfunc4():
  my_list = ["Katia", "Alex", "Grace", "Aba", "Jacob"]
  my_list.sort()
  print(my_list)

myfunc4()
print(my_list)
```

The code above uses a local variable `my_list`. The function sorts the local variable. The global value stays as it was.

> Note: local variables can have the same names as locals in other functions. It does not affect the code, it is fine.

## One line solutions

Functional programming is more than just not using global variables.

Another key feature of functional programming is the fact that we can pass functions as parameter to other functions. As a data analyst you will often do that in Pandas.

In order to make it easier Python introduced a lambda function.

We will start with learning how to write lambdas.

## Shorter functions

Good code is readable, but not verbose.

A good solution to odd or even problem is below:

```python
def even_or_odd(number):
    return 'Odd' if number % 2 else 'Even'
```

## Lambda functions

A one-line solution to the problem above is here:

```python
even_or_odd = lambda number: "Odd" if number % 2 else "Even"
```

# D14S1. Algorithmic Complexity and Comprehensions

Computational complexity is a Computer Science concept that focuses on the amount of resources needed for tasks.

In computational complexity theory, researchers assess the kinds of resources that will be needed for a given type of task to classify different kinds of tasks into various levels of complexity.

## Some codewars

1. Python Loop: [Bug fix](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55c28f7304e3eaebef0000da/python)

2. Python statistics: [Min and max](https://www.codewars.com/kata/577a98a6ae28071780000989/python)

3. Python imperative: [Is it odd?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/555a67db74814aa4ee0001b5/python)

## Complexity of tasks above

Big-O notation is the language we use for talking about how long an algorithm takes to run (time complexity) or how much memory is used by an algorithm (space complexity).

Big-O notation can express the best, worst, and average-case running time of an algorithm.

The Big-O notations we will consider are: O(1) - constant, O(n) - linear and O(n²) - quadratic. There are more of those.

### Constant Big-O or O(1)

The last kata we solved is O(1), e.g.,

```python
def is_even(n): 
    return n%2 == 0
```

The algorithm above always makes exactly one operation as it always get the same amount of data.

### Linear Big-O or O(n)

An algorithm is said to take linear time, or O(n) time when the running time increases at most linearly with the size of the input. A classic linear algorithm is a single loop that loops over an array. The bigger the array the more operations are needed.

From the codewars above the first task was linear:

```python
def create_array(n):
    res=[]
    i=1
    while i<=n:
        res+=[i]
        i+= 1
    return res
```

### Quadratic Big-O or O(n²)

A classic example of O(n²) is operating on matrices.

```python
my_list_of_lists = [[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]

for i in range(0, len(my_list_of_lists)):
    for j in range(0, len(my_list_of_lists[i])):
        my_list_of_lists[i][j] += 1

print(my_list_of_lists)
```

The code above uses a loop inside a loop in order to reach every value in a matrix. As a matrix gets bigger the time complexity will increase directly proportionally to the squared size of input.

## List comprehensions

List comprehensions offer a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.

```python
my_list = [2,4,5,7]
new_list = [2**x for x in my_list ]
print(new_list)
```

The code above will print [4, 16, 32, 128].

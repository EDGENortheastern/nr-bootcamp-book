# D14S1. Algorithmic Complexity and Comprehensions

[Codewars for starter](https://www.codewars.com/kata/57eadb7ecd143f4c9c0000a3/python)

Computational complexity is a Computer Science concept that focuses on the amount of resources needed for tasks.

In computational complexity theory, researchers assess the kinds of resources that will be needed for a given type of task to classify different kinds of tasks into various levels of complexity.

## Some codewars

1. Python Loop: [Bug fix](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55c28f7304e3eaebef0000da/python)

2. Python statistics: [Min and max](https://www.codewars.com/kata/577a98a6ae28071780000989/python)

3. Python imperative: [Is it odd?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/555a67db74814aa4ee0001b5/python)

## Complexity of tasks above

Big-O notation is the language we use for talking about how long an algorithm takes to run (time complexity) or how much memory is used by an algorithm (space complexity).

Big-O notation can express the best, worst, and average-case running time of an algorithm.

The Big-O notations we will consider are: O(1) - constant, O(n) - linear and O(n¬≤) - quadratic. There are more of those.

### Constant Big-O or O(1)

The last kata we solved is O(1), e.g.,

```python
def is_even(n): 
    return n%2 == 0
```

The algorithm above always makes exactly one operation as it always get the same amount of data.

### Linear Big-O or O(n)

An algorithm is said to take linear time, or O(n) time when the running time increases at most linearly with the size of the input. A classic linear algorithm is a single loop that loops over an array. The bigger the array the more operations are needed.

From the codewars above the first task was linear:

```python
def create_array(n):
    res=[]
    i=1
    while i<=n:
        res+=[i]
        i+= 1
    return res
```

### Quadratic Big-O or O(n¬≤)

A classic example of O(n¬≤) is operating on matrices.

```python
my_list_of_lists = [[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]

for i in range(0, len(my_list_of_lists)):
    for j in range(0, len(my_list_of_lists[i])):
        my_list_of_lists[i][j] += 1

print(my_list_of_lists)
```

The code above uses a loop inside a loop in order to reach every value in a matrix. As a matrix gets bigger the time complexity will increase directly proportionally to the squared size of input.

## List comprehensions

List comprehensions offer a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.

```python
my_list = [2,4,5,7]
new_list = [2**x for x in my_list ]
print(new_list)
```

The code above will print [4, 16, 32, 128].

## Sort, map, reduce

The array methods in Python include sort, map, reduce and many others.

## Some codewars 2

Solve some katas with list comprehensions.

1. Python: [List comprehension](https://www.codewars.com/kata/57a083a57cb1f31db7000028/python)

## `.sort()`

Python `.sort()` method sorts values in a list. It affects the original list. `sort()` is a mutating function.

```python
a = [3, 2, 1]
print(a.sort()) # in place
print(a)
```

The code above will print [1, 2, 3] and it will have changed the list a itself.

## Sorted

Python `sorted()` method also sorts values in a list. However, it does not affect the original list. Please pay attention that sorted takes parameter that is a list, whereas `sort()` is chained to the list.

```python
a = [3, 2, 1]
print(sorted(a)) # new list
print(a)
```

## Sorted, sort and lambdas

Both sorted and sort can be used with lambda functions. Lambdas are used to show how to sort. Can you figure what the code below does?

```python
data = ["Alex", "Katia", "Grace", "Gus", "Aba", "Jahia"]
data.sort()
print(sorted(data, key = lambda ch: ch[1]))
```

## Filter

Filter method allows to filter lists without writing loops. Filter also works with lambdas. It is a non-mutating method.

```python
my_list = [2,4,6,7,8,9]
new_list = list(filter(lambda x: (x%2 == 0), my_list))
print(new_list)
```

The code above adds all values in a list.

## Map

Map method allows to alter lists without writing loops. Map also works with lambdas. It is also a non-mutating method.

```python
my_list = [2,4,6,7,8,9]
new_list = list(map(lambda x: x+2, my_list))
print(new_list)
```

The code above adds 2 to every value on a list.

## Reduce

Reduce is yet another method of functional programming. It reduces a list to a single value. A parameter function determines how to reduce.

```python
from functools import reduce
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
new_list = reduce(lambda a, b: a + b, numbers)
print(new_list)
```

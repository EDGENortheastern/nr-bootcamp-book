# D29S1. Data Scraping and Unstructured Data

## Data collection

**Data collection** is the process of gathering, exploring, measuring, and analyzing data from a variety of sources. It is the first stage of the data workflow. Data workflow is also known as the data life cycle.

Collected data may be

- [structured](#structured-data)
- [semi-structured](#semi-structured-data)
- [unstructured](#unstructured-data)

## Structured data

**Structured data** is in a standardized format, has a well-defined structure and adheres to a data model. Structured data usually follows a persistent order and can be easily accessed by humans and software programs. This type of data is normally stored in a database.

Structured data is vital for data analysts and businesses because you can draw inferences and information from it more easily than from other types of data.

## Semi-structured data

There is also semi-structured data, which is text-heavy data that is loosely organized into categories or "meta tags."

This information can be easily broken into groups, but the data within these groups is itself unstructured.

Email is a good example of this: you can search your email by Inbox, Sent, and Drafts, but the email text within each category has no pre-set structure.

## Unstructured data

**Unstructured data** does not adhere to a pre-set data model or schema. It cannot be stored in a traditional relational database. Text, video, audio, and XML files are common types of unstructured content.

Some examples of unstructured data are:

- Medical records
- Social media posts
- Business transactions
- Live chats, text messages and web meetings data
- Images, video and audio
- Survey responses
- Emails
- Publications and listings
- Webpages

## The importance of Unstructured Data

The **majority of data created today is unstructured**.
Even though databases are awesome, the amount of data stored in them cannot be compared with the amount of data in documents, social media, emails.

From 80 to 90 percent of data generated and collected by organizations, is unstructured, and its volumes are growing rapidly ‚Äî many times faster than the rate of growth for structured databases.

For many companies their unstructured data is an untapped resource, so many are only starting to explore its use. When managed in the right way, unstructured data can deliver countless insights that help you make informed, data-driven decisions.

Machine learning technology allows automatically managing and analyzing unstructured data quickly and accurately. Through technological advancements, like natural language processing (NLP), machines can now read text just like a human would. That means you can eliminate repetitive tasks.

AI technology can automatically learn how to extract keywords, names, phone numbers, and locations, understand opinions and intent and recognize topics that are important to your business. Once all your unstructured data has been organized, you‚Äôll gain granular insights that will help you make informed business decisions.

Then most important aspects of using unstructured data analysis for a business are:

- Improved customer experience
- Discovering gaps in the market
- Listening to your customers

## Getting unstructured data

A budding data analyst can get unstructured data from:

- web scraping
- Big Data public data sets

## Getting unstructured data from BigQuery

To demonstrate what unstructured data might look like let us run the following query in Google's BigQuery:

```sql
SELECT
  body
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.stackoverflow_posts`
WHERE
  comment_count>100
  AND EXTRACT(year
  FROM
    creation_date) > 2010;
```

The we can download a local `.csv` file and see the data in a Deepnote.

The above steps have been done for you.

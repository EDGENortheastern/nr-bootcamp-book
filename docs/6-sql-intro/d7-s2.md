# D7S2. Introduction to SQL with Google BigQuery

## Big Query

Google BigQuery is a cloud data warehouse with a built-in query engine.
A data warehouse is a central repository an organization can use to collect enterprise data from various systems such as sales. The purpose of a data warehouse is data analysis rather than data storage. Google Cloud Platform is the provider of the infrastructure. Other well-known providers in the world of data warehouses are:

- Amazon Redshift
- Snowflake Cloud Data Platform
- Microsoft Azure Synapse Analytics

To demonstrate how BigQuery works to their prospective enterprise customers, Google allows you to explore massive, real-world data sets, aka Big Data, via the c interface.

It is possible to use BigQuery public data sets for free without setting up a billing account.

BigQuery uses Standard SQL, a dialect of Structured Query Language (SQL), the primary language for communicating with relational databases and a critical part of the skill stack for a data analyst.

### Getting started with Google BigQuery

The first step to using Google BigQuery is to set up a Google account (e.g., Gmail) if you do not have one.

Then, log in to Google Cloud Console with your Google account:

[https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

Even though Google offers you a pretty good deal for setting up a billing account, do not do that yet, it requires credit card details. Dismiss the offer:

/>

If you are navigating to BigQuery from a Google search, you may end up on a promotional page that urges you to set up billing. Choose to navigate to the Console to avoid entering your credit card details:

/>

Google Cloud Console has a very busy interface. You can search for BigQuery or locate a link to it on Resources card:

## SQL `SELECT` and `AS`

`SELECT` is one of the most frequently used SQL commands. Like Python's print, one can use it without grabbing any actual data.

You can use `SELECT` to explore various SQL operators, e.g., the arithmetic ones:

<img
  src="/img/day-6/queryBigQuery.png"
  alt="Dismiss offer to set up billing"
  class="wide screenshot"
/>

In SQL, a convention is to use all capitals for commands. However, it is faster to type in small caps. BigQuery has a format option to prettify queries:

/>

The `AS` command is used to rename a column or table with an alias.
Try a larger query and let BigQuery format it for you, e.g.:

```sql
select 120/23 as SQL_divides, (true or true) as SQL_Boolean_example, 2+2 as SQL_addd, 25-5 as sql_subtracts;
```

## SQL `DISTINCT`

The `DISTINCT` statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.

```sql
SELECT
  DISTINCT 
  borough
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.london_crime.crime_by_lsoa`
ORDER BY
  borough;
```

## SQL `COUNT`

The `COUNT()` function returns the number of rows matching a specified criterion.

```sql
SELECT
COUNT(DISTINCT city) AS distinct_city_count COUNT(city) AS number_city_records
FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york.311_service_requests`
```

## SQL `LIMIT`

If want to LIMIT the number of results that are returned you can simply use the LIMIT command with a number of rows to LIMIT by.

If we wanted to return a list of the first 10 names sorted in alphabetical order we could execute this query:

```sql
SELECT
  DISTINCT name
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_current`
ORDER BY
  name ASC
LIMIT
  10
```

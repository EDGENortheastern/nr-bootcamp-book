# D6S2. SQL: filtering and sorting

## `WHERE`

The `WHERE` clause is used to filter down the table using specific conditions.
The `WHERE` clause is used with various SQL comparison operators.

### Equal Operator

Return the number of records where the tripduration was equal to 432 seconds.

```sql
SELECT
  count(*) as num_bike_rides
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_trips`
WHERE
    tripduration = 432 
```

### Not Equal Operator

Return the number of records where the tripduration was not equal to 432 seconds.

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS num_bike_rides
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_trips`
WHERE
  tripduration != 432
```

### Less Than

Return the number of records where the tripduration was less than 300 seconds.

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS num_bike_rides
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_trips`
WHERE
  tripduration < 300
```

### Less Than Or Equal

Return the number of records where the tripduration was less than or equal to 300 seconds.

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS num_bike_rides
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_trips`
WHERE
  tripduration <= 300
```

### Greater Than

Return the number of records where the tripduration was greater than 24 hours.

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS num_bike_rides
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_trips`
WHERE
  tripduration > 24*60*60
```

### Greater Than Or Equal

Return the number of records where the tripduration was greater than or equal 24 hours.

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS num_bike_rides
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_trips`
WHERE
  tripduration >= 24*60*60
```

## Combining Multiple Conditions using `AND`

Return the number of records where the tripduration was between 5 hours and 9 hours i.e. greater than or equal to 5 hours and less than or equal to 9 hours.

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS num_bike_rides
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_trips`
WHERE
  tripduration >= 5*60*60 AND tripduration <= 9*60*60
```

## Combining Multiple Conditions using both AND & OR

Return the number of records where the tripduration was between 1 hour and 3 hours OR between 5 and 8 hours. Notice the use of parenthesis around the two statements separated by OR. You need these brackets when chaining together AND and OR conditions within the same clause.

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS num_bike_rides
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_trips`
WHERE
  (tripduration >= 1*60*60 AND tripduration <= 3*60*60)
  OR 
  (tripduration >= 5*60*60 AND tripduration <= 8*60*60)
```

## IN statement

The IN statement can be used to provide a list within a condition. In this example we are counting the records where the tripduration is in the list (60,120).

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS num_bike_rides
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_trips`
WHERE
    tripduration IN (60,120)
```

The above query is the same as saying the tripduration is 60 or the trip duration is 120.

For example, this query which uses multiple OR statements,

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS num_bike_rides
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_trips`
WHERE
    tripduration = 60 or tripduration = 120 or tripduration = 180 or tripduration = 240
```

can be replaced with a query using an IN statement that is easier to write/read.

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS num_bike_rides
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_trips`
WHERE
    tripduration IN (60,120,180,240)
```

## NOT IN Statement

Although we did not cover an example in the video (we will do examples in other videos) you can also use use a NOT IN clause. For example, you can do the negation of the above query. Count the number of records where the trip duration was not one of (60,120,180,240).

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS num_bike_rides
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_trips`
WHERE
    tripduration NOT IN (60,120,180,240)
```

## `ORDER BY`

`ORDER BY` allows to sort records. `DESC` allows sorting in descending order.

If we wanted to return the distinct set of years, starting with the most recent, from the USA names data set we would run this query:

```sql
SELECT
  DISTINCT year
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_current`
ORDER BY
  year DESC
```

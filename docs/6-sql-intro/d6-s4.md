# D6S4. SQL: - Aggregates

Aggregate Functions allow to perform calculations.

Some of the most commons ones are MAX, MIN, AVG, SUM, and COUNT functions along with the GROUP BY statement to achieve these results.

- What was the maximum trip_total?
- What was the minimum trip_total?
- What was the average trip_total?
- What was the total sum of trip_total?
- How many taxi trips were there?

## `MAX`

```sql
SELECT
    MAX(trip_total) as max_trip_total
FROM
    bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips
```

## `MIN`

```sql
SELECT
    MIN(trip_total) as min_trip_total
FROM
    bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips
```

## `COUNT`

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(trip_total) as count_trip_total
FROM
    bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips
```

## `SUM`

Unlike COUNT, SUM does not count the rows, it adds all values.

```sql
SELECT
    SUM(trip_total) as sum_trip_total
FROM
    bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips;
```

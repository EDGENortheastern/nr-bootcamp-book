# D18S3. Statistical Techniques in Pandas

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that the distribution of sample means is a normal distribution regardless of the population's distribution.

CLT proves that the mean of sampled variables from a population will be approximately equal to the mean of the whole population.

## Normal distribution

In general, it is said that Central Limit Theorem starts at an N of about 30 (a sample of 30). In other words, as long as the sample is based on 30 or more observations, the sampling distribution of the mean can be safely assumed to be normal.

The highest point of the Normal distribution graph is located at the mean, which coincides with the mode. The spread of the graph is determined by the standard deviation. There is a concentration of the observations around the mean, which makes sense as it is equal to the mode.

Moreover, it is symmetrical on both sides of the mean.

To plot a Normal Distribution graph you can use:

```python

from scipy.stats import norm # a Maths module
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # a data viz module
import seaborn as sns # a data viz module

# loc is mean, scale is std and size is sample size
sample = norm.rvs(loc=9, scale=7, size=1000, random_state=13)

# Plot the sample
sns.distplot(sample)
plt.show()
```

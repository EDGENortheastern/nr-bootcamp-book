# D18S1. Statistical Measures

## Types of statistics

There are two main types of statistics:

- descriptive statistics
- inferential statistics.

Let us say we want to study the height of students at Northeastern.
The total enrollment in 2002 is 19,940 students (data from a simple Google search).

We take a random sample of 50 students. Python Pandas makes random sampling very easy if you have a data frame (df):

```python
df.sample(n=50)
```

If we had a file of all student details we could do random sampling in minutes, if not seconds. Someone does have this data, too. But we are not going to show anything like that because of data protection laws. However, it is easy to imagine.

In research, when you are interested in a certain population (all Northeastern students), but cannot study all its individuals, you take a sample.

From a sample, you can study some characteristics, e.g., mean height, percentiles.

The sample characteristics are called descriptive statistics.

And from the descriptive statistics, we can estimate some population characteristics. They are known as parameters of a population.

> A parameter is a value that describes a characteristic of an entire population, such as the population mean height.

The population parameters can also sometimes be called inferential statistics.

If we want to measure the mean height of all students we take a sample of 50 students and measure their mean height. Then we estimate the height of the entire population based on that sample mean. Does this approach work? We will find out later today.

## Statistical measures

Let us practice obtaining statistics for a sample.

Some of he most common are:

- [Mean](#mean)
- [Mode](#mode)
- [Median](#median)
- [Standard Deviation](#standard-deviation)
- [Variance](#variance)
- [Percentiles](#percentiles)

The three measures of central tendency are mean, median and mode. A measure of central tendency is **a single value** that attempts to describe a set of data by identifying the central position within that set of data.

We will also learn to build box plots in Pandas. Box plots allow to quickly visualise some key stats.

## Mean

One of the most common summative statistical measures for numerical data is the mean.

The mean is the most common measure of central tendency, but it
has a downside ‚Äì it is easily affected by outliers.

In Pandas a way to get the mean of a column without describe:

```python
df['Column Name'].mean()
```

## Median

Median helps to overcome the problem with outliers.

You find median by putting the numeric values in order from the smallest to largest and figuring out the middle value.

```python
df['Column Name'].median()
```

## Mode

Mode is the value, which appears most often in the set. To find the mode, you need to count how many times each value appears.

The mode is easy to understand and calculate. The mode is not affected by extreme values. The mode is useful for qualitative and quantitative data.

Pandas mode returns several values.
To calculate a single mode in Pandas you can use:

```python
df['Column Name'].mode().mean()
```

## Variance

The variance measures data's dispersion from the mean.

It is computed by finding the difference between every data point and the mean, squaring them, summing them up, and then averaging.

The benefits of squaring to calculate the variance include:

- Squaring always gives a non-negative value, so the sum will always be zero or higher.
- Squaring emphasizes larger differences, a feature that turns out to be both good and bad (think of the effect outliers have).

Both Variance and Standard Deviation are measures of spread.

```python
df['Column Name'].var()
```

We are going o be exploring samples in this session. However, a reminder, `ddof` parameter can be used to calculate population variance.

## Standard Deviation

The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.

```python
df['Column Name'].std()
```

## Percentiles

A percentile (or a centile, quantile) is a measure used in statistics indicating the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group falls.

For example, the 20th percentile is the value (or score) below which 20% of the observations may be found.

25%, median and 75% are known as quartiles.

```python
df['Column Name'].quantile(.25)
```

The code above will return the value below which the 25% of sample data is.

## Box plots

A box plot shows a visual representation of the median and quartiles of a set of data.

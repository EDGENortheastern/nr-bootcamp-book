# D18S2. Statistical Techniques in spreadsheets

## Distributions

We learned that a distribution of a dataset shows us the frequency at which possible values occur.

We also said that there are dozens of distributions. Experienced statisticians can immediately distinguish a Binomial from a Uniform distribution in a quick glimpse at a plot. 

Today we will focus on the Normal distributions. It approximates a wide variety of variables. Distributions of `sample means` with large enough sample sizes could be approximated to Normal distribution. Decisions based on Normal distribution insights have a good track record, i.e., they give reasonably precise results.

A visual representation of a Normal distribution is a bell-shaped curve. 

You have surely seen a normal distribution before as it is the most common one. The statistical term for it is Gaussian distribution, but
many people call it the Bell Curve. It is symmetrical and
its mean, median, and mode are equal. It has no skew. It is perfectly centered around its mean.

## Central Limit Theorem

My data is not normally distributed, then how come I can use a normal distribution? Well, the reason is the Central Limit Theorem.

So the central limit theorem is one of the foundational principles of statistics. What it explains is why one only needs a very small sample size to assume about the entire dataset and why we can assume a normal distribution with our data even when it's not normally distributed.

We will try and demo the Central Limit Theorem using a data set of an entire high school of 1000 students. In high school, we (you, the Americans) have grades eight through 12.

There are exactly 200 students in each grade.

Well, very clearly, this is not a normal distribution. This is a uniform distribution, like rolling a single die.

Let us do the task and get empirical proof of the Central Limit Theorem.

## Spreadsheet formulas you will need

A `countif` formula below counts all values in the C column that equal the value in cell E6.

```text
=COUNTIF(C:C,E6)
```

To get a random value between 1 and 1000:

```text
=RANDBETWEEN(1,000)
```

To get the mean for column C:

```text
=AVERAGE(C:C)
```

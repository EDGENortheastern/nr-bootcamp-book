# D33S1. Plotly Dashboards

A dashboard is a type of graphical user interface. Dashboards are often interactive: you can segment, filter, and change the visualization of your data. They often provide at-a-glance views of key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to a particular objective or business process.

Python dahsboards can be made with two technologies:

- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/)
- [Plotly Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/)

[Plotly Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) allows building true interactive dashboards that visualize live data often coming from an API. Check out their [gallery](https://dash.gallery/Portal/)

However, to produce dashboards with Plotly Dash, one needs to know server side Python and how to deploy web servers.

So, we will be using Plotly subplots to make simpler dashboards.

A dashboard normally consists of several different plots and graphs. A sublot from Plotly Graph Objects allows to do just that.

```python
from plotly.subplots import make_subplots # imports # imports plotly
import plotly.graph_objects as go # imports plotly graph objects as go

fig = make_subplots(rows=3, cols=1) # makes sublots that stack underneath each other

fig.append_trace(go.Scatter( # makes first plot - it is a line graph
    x=als_and_graces.index,
    y=als_and_graces['Number of Graces'],
), row=1, col=1)

fig.append_trace(go.Scatter( # makes second plot - it is a line graph
    x=als_and_graces.index,
    y=als_and_graces['Number of Alexes'],
), row=2, col=1)

fig.append_trace(go.Bar( # makes third plot - it is a bar chart
    x=['Graces', 'Alexes'],
    y=[als_and_graces['Number of Graces'].mean(),als_and_graces['Number of Alexes'].mean()],
    marker=dict(color=['royalblue','gold']),
    showlegend=False
), row=3, col=1)

fig.update_layout(height=600, width=600, title_text="Graces and Alexes in the USA")
fig.show()
```

# D33S3. Advanced data viz

We have learned about many charts and graphs, e.g., box and violin plots, time series graphs, choropleth, geo scatter. We have also learned to make dashboards.

## Project # 4

Create a Plotly dashboard with a range of charts. At least one should have time series. You can use an existing `.csv` from Kaggle, however, to show all your skills I recommend using BigQuery public data sets to get the data.

## Publishing Deepnotes on GitHub instructions

Step 1. Create an empty GitHub repository. Do not even put a README into it.

Step 2. Open the terminal from your Deepnote. Run the following command:

```bash
git init
```

Step 3. Add a remote origin, e.g.,:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/missKatiaPunter/graces_
and_johns.git
```

Step 4. Add your Python to staging on git:

```bash
git add .
```

Step 5. Commit your Python to git, e.g.,:

```bash
git commit -m "Adds the chart"
```

Step 6. Git push or something like:

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin master
```

Step 7. Log in with your GitHub. You may need to first set up an Access token on GitHub. Go to Settings, find the section Developer Settings and follow the steps.

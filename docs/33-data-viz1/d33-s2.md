# D33S2. Plotting Geo data

Geographical plotting is a method of displaying data on a map. I can be done for states of countries, often in a colorful manner.

Geo data visualizations play a significant role in data analysis and visualization. It is often used while building dashboards to present widespread data.

The common types of charts (maps) for geovisualization / geo-data visualization are:

- Choropleth maps
- Dot (Point) maps
- Bubble (Proportional Symbol) maps
- Connector maps
- Flow maps

We will mostly consider two types of geoplots: choropleth and scatter geo. More about them in the Deepnote.

# D21S2 Project Management

## Introduction to Projects

In every organisation lots of activities take place around the clock to keep the business running smoothly. Some of the activities take place repeatedly, and we often consider them routine tasks. For example, when a customer order is received, we would check the inventory, confirm payments, arrange for delivery, and update the customers. Each customer order is different, but we follow more or less the same process to fulfil each customer order. Such routine (business as usual) tasks are hugely important because they usually contribute to the main operations of the organisation. Essentially, they ‘keep the business running’.      

We also see a different set of activities that do not take place repeatedly. Such activities normally have specific goals to achieve. For example, our organisation won a contract to develop a mobile app for the government. Our team spent a lot of time developing the mobile app. Once the mobile app has been signed off by the government (the client in this example), we would not repeat the activities of developing this mobile app. Such activities belong to what we call projects, in contrast of the routine (business as usual) work.

However, all too often, people call any work they do a project. Projects actually have specific definitions. If the work or activities do not meet the set of definitions, they should not be considered projects.

## Definition of a Project

Therefore, we are going to look into what defines a project next. 

The word ‘project’ has been defined by many people and organisations. Let’s look at some of the definitions provided by professional bodies.

'A temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique project service or result.' (Project Management Institute - PMI, 2021) 

'A unique, transient endeavour undertaken to bring about change and to achieve planned objectives' (Association for Project Management - APM, 2017) 

'A temporary organization that is created for the purpose of delivering one or more business products according to an agreed business case' (PRINCE2, 2017) 

Based on the definitions we see here, we can identify the keywords in defining a project. These include unique, result, objectives, and so on. There are plenty of ways of defining a project, but all the definitions cover the keywords. Two of most comprehensive definitions are proposed by Wysocki (2019).

‘A project is a sequence of unique, complex, and connected activities that have one goal or purpose and that must be completed by a specific time, within budget, and according to specification.’ (Wysocki, 2019)

‘A project is a sequence of finite dependent activities whose successful completion results in the delivery of the expected business value that validated doing the project.’ (Wysocki, 2019)

## Key Characteristics of a Project

#### Ad Hoc with a Clear and Finite Lifecycle

A project arises for a specific purpose or to meet a stated goal. Because a project is intended to fulfil a stated goal, it is temporary. It exists only until its goal has been met, and at that point it is dissolved. Projects are activities that are initiated as needed, operate for a specified time period over a fairly well-understood development cycle, and are then disbanded.

Projects are terminated upon successful completion of performance objectives or earlier in their lifecycle, if results no longer promise an operational or strategic advantage. Projects differ from conventional processes in that they are defined by finite lifecycles. They are initiated, completed, and dissolved. As important alternatives to conventional organisational activities, they are sometimes called ‘temporary organisations’.

If a piece of work is ‘on-going’ without a planned end, it is not a project.

#### Enabling Organisational Strategies

Projects are building blocks in the development and execution of organisational strategies. They are the principal means by which organisations operationalise corporate-level objectives. In effect, projects are the vehicles for realising business goals.

For example, Intel’s strategy for market penetration with ever newer, smaller, and faster computer chips is realised through its commitment to a steady stream of research and development projects that allows the company to continually explore the technological boundaries of electrical and computer engineering.

#### Innovation and Change

Projects are responsible for the newest and most improved products, services, and organisational processes. Projects are tools for innovation. Because they complement (and often transform) traditional process-oriented activities, many companies rely on projects as vehicles for going beyond conventional activities. Projects are the stepping-stones by which we move forward. They bring change to our lives.

‘Change’ is an abstract concept until we establish the means by which we can make real alterations in the things we do and produce. Projects allow organisations to go beyond simple statements of intent and to achieve actual innovation. As the vehicle of change, the manner in which a company develops its projects has much to say about its ability to innovate and its commitment to change. Since projects often take us into the unknown, the risk and uncertainty related to projects is greater than that of business-as-usual activities.

#### Cross Functional

Projects require people to work in ways that cross functional and organisational boundaries. Projects enable internal organisational collaboration by bringing together people from various functions (teams and departments) across the organisation, because projects often require expertise from different functions.

A project aimed at new product development may require the combined work of engineering, finance, marketing, design, and so forth. Likewise, in the global business environment, many companies have crossed organisational boundaries by forming long-term partnerships with other organisations in order to maximise opportunities while emphasising efficiency and keeping costs lower.

Projects are among the most common means of promoting collaboration across both functions and organisations.

#### Sequential Activities

A project comprises a number of activities that must be completed in some specified order or sequence. The sequence of the activities is based on technical requirements. For example, we cannot start building the walls of a house before the foundation work is complete. Likewise, software developers cannot start coding until the software requirements are identified and confirmed.

To determine the sequence, it is helpful to think in terms of inputs and outputs. The output of one activity or set of activities becomes the input to another activity or set of activities. A business analyst produces a set of requirements, which will be used by the developers to create the software solution. In this case, the output of the business requirement analysis activity is the input of software development activity. Therefore, requirement analysis must take place before software development.

#### Unique Activities

The activities in a project are unique. Something is always different each time the activities of a project are repeated. A website development company creates websites all the time, but each website is different to suit the unique needs of each client. As a result, the website development company might follow the generic set of processes for every website project, but the activities for each website would not be the same.

However, not all differences are planned for. Sometimes, the variations are random in nature—for example, a part is delayed, someone is sick, or a power failure occurs. These random variations are challenges for the project manager and contribute to the uniqueness of the project.

#### Management Functions

Projects do not just run themselves. The sequential and unique activities mentioned earlier need to be managed. Therefore, the traditional management functions of planning, organising, motivation, directing, and control apply to project management.

Project managers must be technically well versed, proficient at administrative functions, willing and able to assume leadership roles, and above all, goal-oriented. The project manager is the person most responsible for keeping track of the big picture.

The nature of project management responsibilities should never be underestimated because these responsibilities are both diverse and critical to project success.

#### Customer Requirements

The key outcomes of a project are the satisfaction of customer requirements within the constraints of technical, cost, and schedule objectives. The customer, client, or the recipient of the project’s deliverables, expects a certain level of functionality and quality from the project. These expectations can be self-imposed, such as the specification of the project completion date, or client-specified, such as producing the sales report on a weekly basis.

Although the project manager treats the specification as fixed, the reality of the situation is that any number of factors can cause the specification to change. For example, the client may not have defined the requirements completely at the beginning of the project, or the business situation may have changed (which often happens in projects with long durations). It is unrealistic to expect the specification to remain fixed throughout the lifetime of the project. Systems specification can and will change, thereby presenting special challenges to the project manager and project team.

## The Iron Triangle of Project Management

We all try our best to deliver project success. When it comes to projects, wouldn’t it be great if they could all be delivered cheaply and quickly with excellent quality? But sometimes we cannot have everything we want. We have to work with what we have to achieve the best results possible. Therefore, we need to be aware of the three main constraints of project management:

- **Time**
- **Cost**
- **Quality**

Project managers need to balance these three constraints when making decisions that affect project success. The three constraints form what is known as the project management iron triangle. When you have to comprise on at least one of the constraints, which do you choose and how do you choose?

#### The Traditional Project Lifecylce

The traditional (linear) project lifecycle includes four distinct stages: conceptualisation, planning, execution, and termination. Each stage requires a set of activities and cannot move from one to the next without certain requirements being met. The sequential nature of traditional (linear) project management approach is also called 'waterfall' project management approach.

- **Conceptualisation:** development of the initial goal and technical specifications of the project. Key stakeholders are identified and signed on at this phase. This stage is sometimes called ‘initiation’.

- **Planning:** all detailed specifications, schedules, schematics, and plans are developed.

- **Execution:** the actual ‘work’ of the project is performed. As soon as the work starts, the monitoring and control activities start too.

- **Termination:** project output (deliverable) is transferred to the customer, resources reassigned, project is closed out. This stage is also called ‘closure’ or ‘handover’.

#### Project Stakeholders

Project stakeholders are defined as any individuals or groups that can affect or be affected by the objectives, actions and impacts of the project, either positively or negatively.

We work with people. The larger the projects are, the more people we are going to work with. Some of them are part of our project team and some of them are not. Whether they are formally part of our project team or not, these people will have impacts on our projects.

For example, a contractor who is supposed to move our equipment from the old office building to the new building faces staffing issues and cannot complete the move within the originally agreed timeframe. This delay is not caused by our project team; however, it could have a big impact on our schedule.  These people are part of our project stakeholders. Sometimes they can make or break our project and therefore it is essential that we know who they are and how to engage with them to ensure our project success.

#### Identifying Stakeholders

There are plenty of methods and frameworks to help us identify different stakeholders. They all give slightly different stakeholder roles, and they are all correct and valid. Essentially, it is all about identifying the individual and groups rather than the names of the roles. Those methods and frameworks are the tools that help us identify all the stakeholders. For example, if we simply sit down as a project team and try to think of all the stakeholders through a brainstorming session, it is possible that we will miss certain stakeholders. However, if we use a framework, it will force us to look at every different type of stakeholder and try to identify who meets the description of the different roles in our project. 

For example, the Stakeholder Map (Robertson and Robertson, 2012) gives us a comprehensive overview of the common types of stakeholders. This stakeholder map shows the organisational rings surrounding the intended product (the project output), and the classes of stakeholders who inhabit these rings. We can use this map to help determine which types of stakeholders are relevant to our project and which roles you need to represent them.

At the centre of the stakeholder map is the intended product. You might notice that it has a vague, cloud-like shape — this is intentional.  At the early stage of the project (for example, in the conceptualisation stage), we cannot be certain of what the project is going to include and exclude. Therefore, it is loosely defined.

Surrounding the intended product is a ring representing the operational work area — stakeholders who will have some direct contact with the project output (product) inhabit this space. In the next ring, the containing business, we find stakeholders who benefit from the project output (product) in some way, even though they are not in the operational area. Finally, the outer ring, the wider environment, contains other stakeholders who have an influence on or an interest in the product. Note that the detailed and multiple involvement of the core team members (the project team) —analysts, designers, project manager, and so on—is emphasised by the fact they span all the rings.

In this module, we are going to focus on the core project team. Therefore, we are going to explore some of the generic project stakeholder roles and what kind of responsibilities they have.

## Project Scope

Project scope tells us everything about the project, the actual work that needs to be done as well as the expected outputs and outcomes. Project scope informs us of all the activities that need to be performed, the resources to be consumed, and the end project outputs, including the quality standard. Project scope includes a project’s goals, constraints and limitations.

Scope management is the process whereby the outputs, outcomes and benefits are identified, defined and controlled. Scope is the term used in the management of projects to refer to the totality of the outputs, outcomes and benefits and the work required to produce them (APM, Body of Knowledge, 2017).

The effective scoping of a project is as much an art as it is a science. A number of tools, templates, and processes can be used during the scoping effort. That is the science of scoping. Knowing your client, your organisation's environment, and the market situation and how to adapt the tools, templates, and processes to them is part of the art of scoping.

Virtually all of the scoping effort involves an interaction and collaboration between the client who is requesting a service or product and the project manager who is providing the service or product. That collaboration can be very informal or very formal. In both cases, a document is prepared that answers the questions: “What do you need to do?” and “How will you know you did it?” The nature of that relationship will contribute to how the scoping effort proceeds and how successful it is likely to be.

Well executed scope management can avoid scope creep. This is where additional features or functions are added to the new product, or additional requirements are incorporated into the scope, or work is incorporated that is not authorised (i.e., beyond the agreed-upon scope). Scope creep can easily lead to common issues, such as schedule delay, budget overrun, and original requirements not met.

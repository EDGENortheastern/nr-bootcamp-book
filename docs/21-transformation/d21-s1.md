# D21S1. The Cloud and the Platform Business Model

This session explores cloud computing and the importance of the cloud for facilitating new types of business model, including platforms and services.

#### Platforms

A platform is a foundation that you can build upon.

#### Services

A service is something that is provided.

## The Cloud

Originally, most computers were mainframes, with many terminals for users to access. Personal computers (PCs) changed this, as people had their own computers that could do everything needed. 

However, smaller computers and devices lacked the necessary computing power or storage space. Desktop and mobile devices were hitting their limits.

So, the concept of the Cloud originated in the early 1990s.

*the wizard [...] envisioned a network which was not merely a pipeline for messages, but a platform of its own - a seething system where every message was literally a computer program that executed itself as it went out on the Net. Each message would be a software agent, a sort of digital servant performing a task for the person who sent it out. Sounds scary, and actually it is. But if you could control the agents you'd have something terrifically powerful.*
Steven Levy - Bill and Andy’s Excellent Adventure II. Wired. 4th January 1994.

The Cloud allows us to do more than sending messages.

Instead, we can control infrastructure and run complex programs or workloads using this infrastructure.

We can request a computing environment - a virtual machine.

A virtual machine is a software simulation of a hardware device. While a virtual machine is less effective than a physical device, often the server resources used to provide a platform for virtual machines are so powerful that many hundreds of servers can be simulated.

Containers represent the next wave, and are more ‘lightweight’. Instead of simulating the whole computer, including all the complicated operating system components, we are just simulating the top layers in which code is run. This distinction is important for understanding the newer generations of cloud technologies.

## Private and Public Clouds

#### The Private Cloud

An organisation might decide to run a private cloud for its own users and employees. To do this, they will install virtualisation systems that allow people to share server space on premises.

The *private* cloud will allow access to greater computing resources, while preventing waste as unused resources can be used by others. 

#### The Public Cloud

An organisation that has access to large amounts of computing power or storage space might choose to rent out this infrastructure, making available the *public* cloud.

Typically public cloud resources will use a utility model, where consumers are billed for computing resources as they are water or electricity.

#### The Hybrid Cloud

Often organisations will have developed their own infrastructure, but will want to supplement this with the use of public cloud resources.

Organisations will often find it is most useful to rely on the cloud for disaster recovery, for additional storage capacity or for expanding globally.

#### Task

Think about the following use cases.

*Which cloud delivery model would suit?*

A school
A university
A bank
An airport
A startup
A movie streaming service

#### Cloud Expansion

Companies may shift their cloud delivery model over time.

Consider the following example:

## Scaling

#### Examples

The example here represents a traditional company deciding how much infrastructure to provision.

Effectively, this particular business sees traffic shift depending on the day of the week.

Some days they have too much capacity, other days too little.
 
With a traditional data center, there is not much you can do. Servers take time to set up or decommission.

The cloud makes possible different types of scaling.

#### Scaling

- Often gradual, in one direction
- Involves adding capacity only
- Allows simulation of networks and traditional infrastructure

#### Elasticity

- Can scale in as well as out
- Suits erratic, unpredictable workloads
- The system will expand or contract

#### Autoscaling

- Builds on elasticity
- Features partial or complete automation
- Often makes use of AI and predictive analytics

#### Scaling Up and Out

We also see a distinction between *scaling up* and *scaling out*.

In the former case, we are adding capacity through *more powerful* hardware.

In the latter, we are adding capacity through *more* hardware.

Typically, scaling out will be better for most use cases. 

However, managing all the computers was once a difficult problem.

Below is an example of the previous example using a dynamic scaling model.

Here, capacity is added or removed as required. There is always a little beyond what is needed.

#### Task

Think about a university. 

When would scaling be beneficial? When would elasticity be beneficial?

What are the situations in which it might wish to scale up?

What are the situtions in which it might wish to scale out?

## Clouds and Business

The cloud facilitates new types of business models, both inside and outside of the tech world.

See the following [reading](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/za/Documents/strategy/za_The_power_of_platforms.pdf)

In it, John Hagel of public services firm Deloitte discusses the growth of companies focused on delivering platforms, as opposed to products.

Many large tech companies have found themselves transforming their offering from a single core offering to a platform on which people can build. Alternatively, they might recognise their ability to provide infrastructure or data insights, and offer this as a service to other companies.

### Aggregation Platforms

Aggregation platforms act as a marketplace for products. Their primary function is to facilitate transactions.

### Social Platforms

Social platforms act as a space for people to share information and engage in social interactions. They typically feature a mesh model.

### Mobilization Platforms

Mobilization platforms also bring people together, but typically in a more focused, long-term and goal-driven way.

# D21S3. Agile and Scrum 

Agile has become the catchphrase of many organisations as they embrace the digital economy and its disruptive nature. Therefore, it’s important to understand the origins of Agile and how it has come to be a dominant way of working. In this lesson, we’ll explore the overview and history of Agile, and unpack the principles of the Agile Manifesto.

Agile describes a style of working that has the following characteristics:

- *Flexibility*
- *Working closely with customers throughout the process*
- *Ensuring that the solutions (project outputs) actually meet the needs*
- *Making decisions as late as possible*

Some Agile methods are more extensive and project focused, such as DSDM, while other Agile methods are considered ‘lighter’ and are more development focused, such as Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming.

Later in this course, we will explore Scrum.

 As software development became more prominent in the 1990s, developers were becoming increasingly frustrated with traditional business models of top-down decision-making and needed a way to get their products to the market more quickly.

This eventually led to a meeting in 2001 in Snowbird, Utah, where a group of 17 developers who called themselves ‘organisational anarchists’ created and published the Manifesto for Agile Software Development, more commonly known as the Agile Manifesto. It covered four core values:

- *Individuals and interactions over processes and tools*
- *Working software over comprehensive documentation*
- *Customer collaboration over contract negotiation*
- *Responding to change over following a plan*

For the organisational anarchists, the former part of these statements was more important than the latter. This is not to say that the latter should be dismissed completely, but rather that they should not be considered as important as the former. For example, having processes and the right tools is important, but having the right people who can work together effectively is more important.

#### Exercise

Review the following principles. 

*Which do you think are the most relevant for data analytics?*

*Are there any you feel are less relevant nowadays?*

*Are there any you feel are particularly relevant to you?*

- 1. Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software
- 2. Welcome changing requirements, even in late development
- 3. Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months)
- 4. Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
- 5. Projects are built around motivated individuals who should be trusted
- 6. Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
- 7. Working software is the primary measure of progress
- 8. Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
- 9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
- 10. Simplicity – the art of maximising the amount of work not done – is essential
- 11. Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organising teams
- 12. Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly

*Think about Scrum and Waterfall. How would you describe the differences?*

## Comparison

|  | Linear (Traditional/Waterfall)	| Agile |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scope	Follow the specs in detail | Build what clients really need based on priority |
| Requirements | Well-defined and stable from the beginning	| Uncertain and emergent (discovered during the project) |
| Process | Linear | Iterative |
| Delivery	| 'Big Bang' at the end | Small but frequent (incremental) |
| Organisations |	Departments (Larger) | Teams (Smaller) |
| Location | Co-located or distributed | Co-located |
| Review | Normally at pre-defined review | Very frequent (at each iteration) |

## Scrum

Often described as an Agile project management framework, Scrum is a process framework that helps teams solve complex problems and develop and deliver products of the highest possible value within a specified timeframe.

Before we go any further, it’s important to note that Scrum is development focused, unlike DSDM which is project focused.

Scrum emerged out of the manufacturing industry in 1986 and was then extended to the software development industry as an Agile methodology in response to the Waterfall-style project management process.

Describing a set of meetings, tools, and roles that work in concert to help teams structure and manage their work, Scrum encourages teams to:

*Learn through experience*
*Self-organise while working on a problem*
*Celebrate wins and losses to continuously improve*

The image below gives an overview of the Scrum framework. We will learn about the different elements within the framework later on.

## Values, Principles and Processes

The Scrum framework is driven by values, principles and processes. Let’s look at these in further detail.

#### Values

**Courage:** Team members have the courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems.

**Focus:** Everyone focuses on the work of the sprint and the goals of the team.

**Commitment:** People personally commit to achieving the goals of the team.

**Respect:** Team members respect each other to be capable, independent people.

**Openness:** The team and its stakeholders agree to be open about all the work and challenges with performing the work.

#### Principles

**Transparency:** The team works within an environment where everyone is open and aware of what the other team members are working on and the challenges they’re running into. Teams discover issues within the team and the organisation, that may block the team’s success. Often, these issues may have been present for a long time.

**Inspection:** Various inspection points (daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and sprint retros) are built into the framework, allowing the team to reflect on the process and evaluate how it’s working.

**Adaptation:** The team is constantly evaluating how things are going and revising or adapting as they go, allowing them to ‘fail quickly’ and swiftly pivot to implement solutions or changes.

One of Scrum’s most notable features is the sprint. A sprint is a short, time-boxed (see M5-L4 Timeboxing) period of time that the Scrum team works within to finish a predefined set of work. Designed to break down large projects into manageable chunks, sprints are no longer than one month, and allow teams to deliver high-value work more frequently.

Sprint cycles typically consist of four events as follows:

**Sprint Planning Meeting:** The sprint planning meeting is a collaborative meeting where the team determines what will get done and how it will get done.

**Daily Standup (Daily Scrum):** During the daily stand-up/daily Scrum, we quickly check-in on how the work is progressing with the goal of discovering blockers or risks to the team’s achievement of the Sprint goal.

**Demo (Review):** During the daily stand-up/daily Scrum, we quickly check-in on how the work is progressing with the goal of discovering blockers or risks to the team’s achievement of the Sprint goal.

**Retrospective:** The sprint retrospective provides a chance to reflect on the previous sprint to identify any process changes to be implemented for the next sprint. Retros typically focus on both what worked well and what didn’t.

#### Ready and Done

A product being **Ready** refers to a user story or item that is ready to be worked on. In order for a user story to be ready, it needs to be clear, feasible and actionable. Importantly, everyone must have a shared understanding of it.

On the other hand, the definition of a product being done describes the qualities that a user story should have in order to be considered done/completed. Take note that the task should be granular enough so that **Done** becomes obvious.

Next, let’s take a look at how the elements of Sprint, Ready and Done come together within the Scrum framework.

Consider the following examples:

In a software company, a team may need to ask the following questions to determine their Definitions of Done (DoD):

- *Is the code complete?*
- *Has the code been peer-reviewed?*
- *Has the code been checked-in?*
- *Have the unit tests been passed?*
- *Would any of the above steps be a user story or item on its own?*

Once the team reaches the end of the sprint, the stakeholders are expecting the improvements to be live in production, but there is still testing and follow-up actions to be done. As a result, there is a delay in delivery.

To ensure there is no misunderstanding on what the requirements and expectations are, it’s important that the team and stakeholders are aligned on what constitutes ‘ready’ and ‘done’. If this is not clearly defined from the outset, the team may end up either having to work beyond the sprint to meet the expectations of stakeholders or may have gone ‘too deep’ beyond what was expected to be delivered.

#### Testing

Scrum testing is the test of the product delivered from the perspective of the customer or end-user. The main goal is to assess how effectively the product meets the needs of the customer. Depending on the type of product being delivered, the type of testing done will vary, but the key purpose is to determine whether the end product or its features deliver value to the customer and that their requirements have been met.

#### Release

Once the testing is complete, it’s time to release. Releasing a version is the culmination of your team's hard work. Releases in Scrum enable us to answer questions like: When will we be done? or Which features can I get by the end of the year?

Releases can be planned through a release plan. Release plans:

- *Allow objectives and priorities to be set with respect to the immediate road map within the team*
- *Accelerate feature development by level setting on requirements as a team, thereby reducing multiple meetings which might be needed otherwise*
- *Allow for evaluating priority and discussing trade-off options*
- *Allow for thinking through the scope/functionality as a team and identifying dependencies, risk/mitigation and potential impediments*
- *Allow goals to be set and the measurement of performance benchmarks*

All the processes within Scrum rely on teams. Let’s look at the different Scrum roles next.

## Roles

#### Scrum Master

The scrum master focuses on promoting Scrum:

- Values
- Transparency
- Self-organisation
- Empiricism

#### Product Owner

The three key responsibilities of the product owner include:

*Product backlog management*
This means that the product owner should know about everything that is in the backlog. Others who add items to the product backlog should ensure that they communicate with the product owner.

*Release management*
As the sprint cycle is a planning cycle and not a release cycle, Scrum teams can deliver at any time. The product owner should know when things can and should be released.

*Stakeholder management*
Product owners will work with many stakeholders such as customers, users, governance and organisational leadership to ensure that the development team is creating and delivering value.

#### Development Team

The responsibilities of the development team include:

- Doing the work within the sprint
- Participating in Scrum processes and ceremonies
- Practising Scrum values.

#### Scrum and Management

It’s important to note that Scrum is a framework with a focus on building complex products. It’s not a business model framework and does not include management roles.

Now, while the Scrum framework defines three distinct roles, it does not particularly address the roles of executives, managers and leaders. This can cause friction between Scrum teams and managers as role definition may become unclear.

However, teams continue to need managers in the form of strong leaders who have core decision-making responsibilities.

## Artefacts

 In software development, the term ‘artefact’ is used to describe the key information needed through the development of a product. They’re produced through the main activities of the sprint and describe the product being developed, the actions needed to create it, and other actions performed during the project. These artefacts can then be used to provide insight into the performance of the sprint, making them a valuable resource for reflection, including the sprint retro.

The main artefacts which are a part of the Scrum framework are product backlog, sprint backlog and the product increment.

#### Product Backlog

The product backlog is the ordered list of requirements (enhancements, new features, and bug fixes, or other things that need to be built into the product). They’re compiled from a variety of sources including customers, customer support, competitive analysis, market analysis, and other sources. The product owner, with the support of the scrum master, is responsible for prioritising, curating, and maintaining or ‘grooming’ the backlog.

User stories (See M5-L2 User Stories) (as the requirements) are stored in the product backlog. The product backlog is a living artifact in the sense that it is constantly evolving as new information is received or discovered. It contains upcoming or planned work as well as work that was once in scope within a sprint and then was deprioritised to the backlog.

Essentially, the product backlog is the list of all the items that need to be completed so that the end product can be developed.

#### Sprint Backlog

The Sprint backlog is the collection of tasks that are needed to deliver on an item within the product backlog and is a living artifact that is updated on a daily basis. You can keep the Sprint backlog electronically, for instance, within an Excel spreadsheet or via cards on a task board.

For example, when developing a new product, a new team member starts to work on an activity that requires them to ‘develop a new product’. The product backlog item would be to ‘create a new product’. There are multiple tasks required across different functions to create the new product. These multiple tasks would fall within the sprint backlog. These are the tasks that are considered ‘in scope’ or ‘planned’ to complete within the sprint.

The sprint backlog is revised as part of sprint planning as the team determines what’s required to deliver on the product backlog item and who will be doing what.

Essentially, the sprint backlog is the list of all the items that have been taken from the Product Backlog and have to be completed so that the sprint is completed. It also includes a plan on how the selected items will be converted to an increment.

#### Product Increment

A product increment is a step towards the vision or the goal and is the sum of all product backlog items completed during a sprint in addition to all the increments of previous sprints. The scope of the product increment is agreed with stakeholders and defined by the product owner.

The product increment must be in a usable condition, regardless of the product owner’s decision to release it or not.

Note that the increment should deliver a business value, and it isn’t just a part of the technology stack. So, at the end of a sprint, the new increment must be ‘done’, which means that it is in a usable condition and meets the Scrum team’s definition of ‘done’.

Product and sprint backlogs and product increments are facilitated by Scrum ceremonies.

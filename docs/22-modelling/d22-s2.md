# D22S1 Business Modeling

Business process modeling helps many companies to document the business processes that they have. This means they will be able to quickly analyze their workflow. On a long-term basis, it means that a company can adapt and improve with precision and effectiveness.  Here is more useful information you should know:

*Business process modeling helps the entire team figure out how the process is working.*
*The documentation can be done using both words and visuals. This will help to bring a clearer representation.*
*It improves communication because when a company goes through a change the entire flow of the processes can still be kept using a process model.*
*Knowing how the current processes are behaving is important because you can check if they are aligned with the organisational strategies.*
*Business process modeling helps by offering constant processes.*
*Organisations that work well, rely on streamlined processes. They must map them out in order to see all the steps of the operations and keep everyone at the same level.*
*It helps in reducing and kind on inefficiencies. This happens as better resource utilisation is being done and when stakeholders begin to know their roles.*

Business process modeling software allows you to represent your process in a digital way that can then be transferred to a live automated process.

Business process modeling can help you group similar processes together and anticipate how they should operate. The primary objective of business process modeling tools is to analyse how things are right now and simulate how should they be carried out to achieve better results.

#### BPMN

A key to Business Process Management, it visually depicts a detailed sequence of business activities and information flows needed to complete a process. The following diagram shows an example of a BPMN, to demonstrate the payment methods accepted by an organisation, that is cash or credit card.

Its purpose is to model ways to improve efficiency, account for new circumstances or gain a competitive advantage. The method has been undergoing a standardization push in the past few years and is now often called by a slightly different name: Business Process Model and Notation, still using the BPMN acronym.

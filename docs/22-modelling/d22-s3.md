# D21S3. Strategic Planning

## Organizational Goals

A vision statement defines the desired future position of an organisation. It translates into goals and objectives, which provides organisations with a blueprint to achieve a future state.

A goal is a future state that an organisation strives to achieve. Goals are followed by objectives.

Organisational goals have four basic functions. They are to:

*provide guidance and direction*
*facilitate planning*
*motivate and inspire employees*
*help the organisation to evaluate and control performance.*

Objectives are short-term targets with measurable results. They can be corporate performance objectives or other relevant objectives.

There are two main approaches for setting goals and objectives:

#### Top-down approach

In a top-down approach, senior managers set the objectives based on organisational needs, and then cascade them to lower management. Management by objective (MBO) is a commonly used top-down approach to objective setting.

**Advantages**
- The goals and objectives are tied to the organisation’s mission and vision.
- The goals and objectives remain ambitious.

**Disadvantages**
- Over-ambitious goals.
- Inflexibility, because goals set at top organisational tiers wouldn't change as the organisational changes.
- Employee participation not included in goal setting.

#### Bottom-up approach

In a bottom-up approach, senior managers ask lower-level managers to set their objectives, which are then reviewed by senior management. Operational goals and objectives determine tactical objectives, and these are translated into strategic goals and objectives.

**Advantages**
- The goals and objectives are more realistic,
- The goals and objectives are more flexible and reflect the organisation’s current situation.

**Disadvantages**
- Goals and objectives are not always aligned with the organisation’s mission.
- A lack of hierarchical alignment with the goals of the organisation.
- Goals could lack ambition.

#### Critical Success Factors

Critical success factors of a strategic planning process are:

*a supportive leadership culture*
*flexibility: one size does not fit all*
*shared accountability and personal responsibility*
*a sense of urgency and effective communication*
*a calibrated strategy that is cascaded through the organisation.*
The functions and tasks in the strategic planning process are distributed among strategy formulation, implementation, and evaluation.

Key roles in the strategic planning process are:

**directors**, who provide a strategic framework
**senior management**, who drive the SMART goals framework and facilitates benchmarking activities
**facilitators** who steer strategic planning discussions.

## SMART Objectives

**Specific:** Are they clear, well defined and unambiguous?
**Measurable:** Can you measure progress against specific criteria?
**Achievable:** Is the goal attainable, and do you know how much effort will be required?
**Realistic:** Are you motivated and able to achieve the goal?
**Time-bound:** Do you have a clearly defined timeline with a sense of urgency?

#### Examples

Example 1

I will have a job as a high-school maths teacher within three months of graduating with my Bachelor of Science in Education.

**Specific:** The goal of becoming a high-school maths teacher is defined.
**Measurable:** Success can be measured by the number of applications, interviews, and job offers.
**Achievable:** The goal setter has an appropriate degree for the job.
**Realistic:** The goal setter plans to achieve the goal within a realistic time after graduating from university.
**Time-bound:** The goal setter has set a deadline to achieve their objective within three months of graduation.

Example 2

I will earn a promotion to the senior customer-service representative by completing the required training modules in three months, and applying for the role at the end of next quarter.

**Specific:** The goal setter has set a clear objective to be promoted to senior customer-services rep.
**Measurable:** Success can be measured by completing the training module, filing the application, and earning the promotion.
**Achievable:** The goal setter can complete the training necessary to earn the promotion.
**Realistic:** The goal setter plans to apply for the promotion after finishing their training modules.
**Time-bound:** The goal setter has set a deadline to achieve their objective at the end of the following business quarter.

### Case Study 

Salesforce is a Software-as-a-Service platform, centred around a Customer Relationship Management offering. Like many other Cloud companies, it has hugely expanded in the last two decades, going public in 2004. In recent years, Salesforce has acquired a number of high-profile IT tools, including communications platform Slack, data visualisation platform Tableau, and the Mulesoft integration system. By 2021, it had displaced Oil Giant Exxon Mobil from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index of thirty companies seen as core to the US Economy. It had more than fifty thousand employees and more than sixty offices, spread across continents. 

Salesforce was founded in 1999 by Marc Benioff, Parker Harris, Dave Mollenhoff and Frank Dominguez. Beinoff, who continues to act as Chief Executive Officer, had worked at Oracle, an established developer of Databases. As a teenager, he had developed video games and other software (his first explained 'How To Juggle'), and eventually earned enough to put himself through college. After a summer internship at Apple, Benioff joined Oracle, initially to answer phones. When he sent a note to Larry Ellison, the CEO, when the product would be available on a Mac, Ellison responded by putting him charge of this department. Benioff became close to Ellison, the CEO and left the company to start his own with his support. At the same time, the two have since clashed publicly. Benioff enlisted the help of Left Coast Software, a small team of developers including Harris and Mollenhoff, who have both served as Chief Technology Officer (CTO), and Dominguez. 

*"During my tenure at Oracle, the company exploded into the second-largest software company in the world, right after Microsoft. Although its culture prized innovation, the company could no longer respond quickly or easily to new directions or opportunities."*

The idea for Salesforce.com is said to have come in Hawaii while Benioff was on a meditation retreat, swimming with dolphins. While Oracle had revolutionised the Database industry and pre-empted the Cloud by moving to a more accessible or hosted offering, it still required a degree of development before clients could use it to track sales effectively. In addition, Oracle's detractors pointed to its layoffs, its disinterested CEO, and its disputes with rivals and the open-source community. Salesforce promised a solution that was not only hosted but also which provided a preestablished data model for managing customer interactions and sales. 

Salesforce was also built taking inspiration from the philosophical advances in the Sales profession itself. Rather than simply seeing its end-users as 'customers', it treated them as part of a community. This entailed outreach through live events - such as Dreamforce, a conference that features more than 150,000 attendees and is frequently headlined by Metallica - and training programs for clients. Philanthropy and volunteering is encouraged for employees, and there are dedicated floors for outreach events. Salesforce draws upon Hawaiian culture through its use of the word 'Ohana' - meaning the extended family. 

Beinoff also claimed that while Oracle had developed into the major database provider in the 1980's and 1990's, there was still no long term vision for the company.  

*"I went out to look for help. I sought wisdom from leadership gurus, personal development gurus, and even spiritual gurus. Over time, I realized that many of these seemingly disparate sources shared striking similarities. I looked to employ these common threads in my own work, and over time I developed them into my own management process, V2MOM, an acronym that stands for vision, values, methods, obstacles, and measures."*

*"In the first few weeks of operation at salesforce.com, I suggested that my cofounders and I define a V2MOM and commit it to writing.  Although Parker may have thought it was somewhat strange at the time, something made him save the original salesforce.com V2MOM, which I had scribbled on a large American Express envelope. He framed it and gave it to me on the day of our IPO [Initial Public Offering - when a company has grown large enough to be publicly traded]."* 

Today each new Salesforce employee produces a V2MOM to help them plan their development within the company; they also use the process for coaching for high school and college students, new entrepreneurs, and clients who use the Salesforce platform.

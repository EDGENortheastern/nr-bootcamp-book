# D30S3. Recap

## Project 3 session

So far you should have built 2 projects and stored then on GitHub to show your prospective employers:

- top 10 movies (introduction to Pandas)
- library database in SQL

Please keep working on those to polish them.

As a third project we recommend obtaining some data that you are interested in and visualing its most important insights. As a source of data you can use:

- BigQuery public data sets. Make sure to include your SQL in the readme.
- Scrape some data
- Use a public API to get some data
- Get a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) data set

## Deepnotes

Here are some starter Deepnotes for you:

1. Visualise Happiness. Data source - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ajaypalsinghlo/world-happiness-report-2021)

## Practice task

Using Google's BigQuery explore the dataset:

`bigquery-public-data.new_york_trees.tree_census_2015`.

Count trees and group them by health.

Convert data into .csv and make a pie chart in deepnote

# D30S1. Data visualization with Plotly

Data visualisation is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs and maps, data visualisation tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers and patterns in data.

## Choose the right plot

To succeed in data visualization, you need to choose [the right plot](https://www.data-to-viz.com/) and tools.

## Choose the right tool

### Matlotlib

Python has many data visualization packages. [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is one of the most used libraries among them. It has a range of plots that you can quickly build and customize.

[Data Camp](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-python/matplotlib?ex=1) has several pathways that recreate the famous data viz by Hans Roslings. [Hans Rosling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Rosling) was the co-founder of the Gapminder Foundation, an organization dedicated to educating the public by using data to dispel common myths about the so-called developing world. You should give this Data Camp activity a try, it is so much fun to re-build something so famous.

### Seaborn

[Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) is another library for making statistical graphs in Python. It builds on top of [Matplotlib](#matplotlib) and integrates closely with Pandas data structures.

Seaborn helps you explore and understand your data. Its plotting functions operate on dataframes and arrays containing whole datasets. It helps perform the necessary semantic mapping and statistical aggregation to produce informative plots. Its simple syntax lets you focus on what the different elements of your plots mean, rather than on the details of how to draw them.

As it has just been mentioned Seaborn is great for building statistical charts. For example, the small code block below allows to build the line of best fit (linear regression):

```python
import seaborn as sns
ax = sns.regplot(x="Ladder score", y="Logged GDP per capita", data=happy_df)
```

In the code block above `happy_df` is a Pandas data frame, whereas "Ladder score" and "Logged GDP per capita" are its column titles.

You can easily custtomize Seaborn graphs, e.g.,:

```python
ax1 = sns.regplot(x="Ladder score",
                y="Logged GDP per capita",
                data=happy_df,
                scatter_kws={"color": "black"},
                line_kws={"color": "red"})
ax1.set_xlabel("Happiness Score")
ax1.set_title("Happiness and GDP per capita");
```

The code above builds the linear regression graph below:

Data Camp has many [Seaborn courses](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-data-visualization-with-seaborn).

### Plotly

Plotly is the Python Library for **interactive88 data visualizations. Plotly is very powerful at explaining and exploring data.

Plotly visualizations can be convertedd into web sites easily.

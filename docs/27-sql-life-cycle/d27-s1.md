# D27S1. Relational Databases and SQL

## Data and databases

What is **data**? Data can be facts related to any object. For example, your name, age, and height are data related to you. Pictures, images, and files can also be considered data.

To store data we need a database. A database can be paper-based. Some British doctors still have those.

What is a **database**? It is a collection of information that is organized so that it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. Information is then organized in a structure that helps to manage the database.

**A database management system** (DBMS) is system software for creating and managing databases. It provides users and programmers with the system to create, update and retrieve data.

Where are databases used? They are used as part of **websites.**
They store all the information that's used to display on the Web site.
They are also used in **desktop applications** to store the data that is required to be displayed and completed by the user.
They are used by **phone apps** and they are also used by internal systems used by utilities, phone **companies,** insurance, doctors, and many other companies you deal with every day.

Modern databases contain things called **tables.**
A table is an object used to store data.
A table is like a spreadsheet, e.g., Excel or Google Sheets.
Tables have rows and columns.
They also have names.

There are a couple of alternatives to using a database.
One alternative is a flat text file.
It is a text file for storing data. Another alternative is a `.json` file which is like a Python Dictionary wrapped in a file.
Files are easy to open and read, but not so easy to update, search and reshape.

## Different types of databases

There are several main types of databases used in applications, and each of them has its pros and cons:

- [relational databases](#relational-databases)
- NoSQL databases, e.g., [Mongo DB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/)
  - graph databases, e.g., [neo4j](https://neo4j.com/docs/)
  - wide-column databases, e.g., [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest)

## Relational Databases

Why use relational databases?

- No data duplication ðŸ‘¯
- Data consistencyðŸ“‡ / accuracy âœ… / integrity
- Easy to update ðŸ“¥
- Improved security ðŸ”’
- Save memory ðŸ’¾

Relational databases store data in tables. Database tables can be visualized as spreadsheets. All tables have rows and columns; rows are used for observations, columns for features.

| Dog ID | Name | Breed | Color
| :- | -: | :-: | -: |
| 1  | Pluto | Poodle | White |
| 2 | Rover | Borzoi | Brown |

The first step to make a database for storing information about dogs is to build the table structure. During this step we call column names **attributes**. Attributes are defined with names and data types.

Rows in a relational database are also known as records.

One of the atributes in a relational database has to be set as a **Primary Key**.

---

ðŸ”‘ A Primary Key is a unique identifier of a record in database table.

---

When we define a table it is important to define its Primary Key.

## ER diagrams

An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a picture representing the structure of a database. It shows the relationships of entity sets and how tables are linked via primary and secondary keys.

## Building a SQL database

### `CREATE`

`CREATE` statements create database tables and build the relationships between tables.

When attributes (the future columns of database tables) are defined, they have to be of specific data types.

### SQLite data types for defining attributes

Some of the SQLite data types are:

| Name | Type | Description |
| :- | :- | -: |
| INTEGER  | INTEGER | Whole numbers, e.g., 32, 5, -20  |
| REAL | REAL | Numbers with a decimal point, e.g., 1.2, -3.2 |
| VARCHAR  | VARCHAR  | Variable strings of characters, text, e.g., "hello" |
| TEXT  | TEXT | Longer strings |

The SQL code below creates table `criminal` with the PRIMARY KEY criminal_id.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS criminal (
  criminal_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(40),
  last_name VARCHAR(40),
  dob DATE,
  gender VARCHAR(1)
);
```

The table below links the table above via the PRIMARY KEY criminal_id.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS criminal_case (
  criminal_id INTEGER,
  officer_id INTEGER,
  summary VARCHAR(150),
  charge VARCHAR(40),
  date_opened INTEGER,
  date_closed INTEGER,
  FOREIGN KEY (criminal_id) REFERENCES criminal(criminal_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (officer_id) REFERENCES officer(officer_id),
  PRIMARY KEY (criminal_id, officer_id)
);
```

## `INSERT`

When we create database tables, we develop only a database structure. For a database to contain some data, records need to be inserted. SQLite allows inserting one record at a time, e.g.:

```sql
INSERT INTO officer (officer_id, first_name, last_name, dob, gender, precinct_no, police_rank) VALUES
(100, 'Jake', 'Peralta', strftime('%s', '1987-11-17'), 'M', 99, 'Detective'),
(101, 'Rosa', 'Diaz', strftime('%s', '1985-11-05'), 'F', 99, 'Detective'),
(102, 'Raymond', 'Holt', strftime('%s', '1960-03-15'), 'M', 99, 'Captain'),
(103, 'Terry', 'Jeffords', strftime('%s', '1975-06-25'), 'M', 99, 'Lieutenant'),
(104, 'Amy', 'Santiago', strftime('%s', '1982-08-19'), 'F', 99, 'Sargeant'),
(105, 'Charles', 'Boyle', strftime('%s', '1980-02-19'), 'M', 99, 'Detective'),
(106, 'Keith', 'Pembroke', strftime('%s', '1978-06-25'), 'M', 69, 'Captain'),
(107, 'Teddy', 'Wells', strftime('%s', '1982-03-12'), 'M', 78, 'Sargeant'),
(108, 'Debbie', 'Fogle', strftime('%s', '1980-04-21'), 'F', 69, 'Officer'),
(109, 'Adrian', 'Pimento', strftime('%s', '1972-08-16'), 'M', 78, 'Officer'),
(110, 'Melanie', 'Hawkins', strftime('%s', '1962-06-10'), 'F', 69, 'Lieutenant');
```

The code above inserts recors into the table officer.
`strftime('%s', '1987-11-17')` is one of the ways to add datetime data in SQLite.
The database will store values in seconds that have passed from UTC 1st of January 1970. It is a good method for time calculations.

## `UPDATE`

The SQL `UPDATE` Query is used to modify the existing records in a table. You can use the `WHERE` clause with the `UPDATE` query to update the selected rows.

```sql
UPDATE dogs
SET color = "white"
WHERE dogid = 2;
```

Without a `WHERE` clause an `UPDATE` statement will update all records in a table. Oops, all dogs turned orange:

```sql
UPDATE dogs
SET color = "orange";
```

You can use optional update statements in your NYPD task later.

## NYPD - build a database task

Below are two alterantive schemas, a simple one and a more complex one (`Simple` and `Full` sheets).

The Google Sheet is simply a medium to show you the schema. The task is to rebuild the NUPD database using replit.

The replit starter (simplest) is below.

### The task

Recreate the NYPD schema in REPLIT, insert the data, produce some reports, push to GitHub and add an ERD to README.

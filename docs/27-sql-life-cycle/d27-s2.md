# D27S2. SQL Queries and Joins

## SQL Queries

SQL queries allow you to retrieve data from the database, to show it.

## SQL `SELECT` and `AS`

`SELECT` is one of the most frequently used SQL commands. Like Python's print it shows the data.

The `AS` command is used to rename a column or table with an alias, e.g.:

```sql
SELECT first_name as [First Name],
last_name as [Last Name]
FROM officer;
```

The code above will only select `first_name` and `last_name` from `officer`.
It will rename the column into "First Name" and "Last Name."
Only SQLite allows the use of square brackets `[]` for renaming into phrases with spaces.

SQLite `date()` function allows to view unixepoch datetime date in a human readable format.

```sql
SELECT first_name as [First Name],
last_name as [Last Name],
date(dob, 'unixepoch') as DOB
FROM officer;
```

SQLite `datetime()` function allows to view unixepoch datetime date and time in a human readable format.

```sql
SELECT first_name as [First Name],
last_name as [Last Name],
date(dob, 'unixepoch') as DOB
FROM officer;
```

Try the above in your NYPD task below.

## Joins

Joining tables means to JOIN columns from one table to another table.
You must give some join condition to join two or more tables.

This is typically done when there is a column or columns in common between tables.
The most common join is via a Primary and a Foreign Keys.

## Types of joins

There are many types of SQL joins such as cross joins and outer joins.

The far most common joins are the inner join and the left join. The right join is less common but it also exists. SQLite has only inner and left joins.

## Inner Join

The `INNER JOIN` selects all rows/records from both participating tables as long as there is a match (a common value) between the columns.

An inner join between the transactions table and the users table on user_id keeps all the records for which the join condition is met in **both tables.** In this example, it means that if there is a user_id which exists in both the transactions table and users table, then the corresponding records will be in the final result after joining.

When joining two tables you often alias both tables. We will used an alias of t on the transactions table and an alias of u on the users table. We can then use the alias of each table within the SELECT statement as well as the ON statement. The ON statement specifies the logic to join on. In the SELECT statement we specify which columns we want from either table. Here we are simply joining where the user_id from the two tables are equal:

```sql
SELECT
    t.transaction_id,
    t.user_id,
    u.user_id as user_id_from_users_table,
    u.name
FROM
    transactions t
INNER JOIN
    users u 
ON 
    t.user_id = u.user_id
```

The code above will get only user who had transactions and their transactions.

## Left Join

The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (transactions), and the matched records from the right table (users). The result is NULL from the right side, if there is no match.

```sql
SELECT
    t.transaction_id,
    t.user_id,
    u.user_id as user_id_from_users_table,
    u.name
FROM
    transactions t
LEFT JOIN
    users u 
ON 
    t.user_id = u.user_id
```

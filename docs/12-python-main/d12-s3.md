## Data types revision

Python variables can be of the following data types:

| Name | Type | Description |
| :- | :- | -: |
| Integer  | int | Whole numbers, e.g., 32, 5, -20  |
| Float  | float | Numbers with a decimal point, e.g., 1.2, -3.2 |
| String  | str | Strings of characters, text, e.g., "hello" |
| Boolean  | bool | True or False |
| List  | list | Ordered collections of values, e.g., `[23,"hello",4.5]` |
| Dictionary  | dict | Unordered key-value pairs, e.g., `{name: "Alex", age: 21}` |
| Tuple  | tup | Unchangeable (immutable) collections, e.g., `(2,3)`|
| Set  | set | Collections of unique value, e.g., `{"a","b"}`|

## Lists

Python list is a container that can store elements of all the data types as a collection. An element is a value in a list.

Unlike a NumPy array a list can have different types of data:

```python
mixed_list = [1, 'Katia', "Alex", 3.4, True]
```

Lists can be matrices (2d lists):

```python
list_of_lists = [[1,2,3], ['Good', 'Better', 'Best']]
```

To access each value in a list we use square brackets:

```python
mixed_list[0]  #indexing starts from 0, so this will get the first element
```

We can overwrite values in lists:

```python
small_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(small_list)
small_list[0] = 10
print(small_list)
```

The output of the code above is: `[10, 2, 3]`

To add a value to the end of a list we use `append()`:

```python
small_list.append('New')
```

The output of the code above is: `[10, 2, 3, 'New']`

The reverse of append is `pop()`

```python
new_small_list = small_list.pop()
```

The code above will remove the last value from `small_list`, not `new_small_list`.

## Tuples

A Python Tuple is used to store a large number of values of any data type in one single variable. Tuples are **immutable**, their values cannot be changed.

```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
```

You can access each element of a tuple with square brackets, e.g., `print(my_tuple[0]`

However, **you cannot overwrite**:

```python
my_tuple[0] = 10 # will break your code
```

## Dictionaries

A Python Dictionary is a data collection that has key-value pairs.

```python
my_dict = {'key1':'value1', 'key2':'value2', 'key3':'value3'}
print(my_dict['key1'])
```

The code above will return 'value1'.

## Sets

A Python Set is a data collection with all unique values.

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

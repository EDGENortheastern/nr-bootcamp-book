# D12S2. Conditions and Pattern Matching

## Pattern Matching

Pattern matching allows you to match a value (or an object) against some patterns to select a branch of the code to execute.

Regular expressions (Regex) are patterns used to match character combinations in strings.

We used some pattern matching in Pandas. The code below replaces all commas with nothing in the column 'Gross' of the data frames my_data_frame:

```python
my_data_frame['Gross'] = my_data_frame['Gross'].str.replace(',','')
```

The function below removes all '!':

```python
def remove_exclamation_marks(s):
    return s.replace('!', '')
```

`.replace` is only one of methods that allows to use patttern matching on strings.

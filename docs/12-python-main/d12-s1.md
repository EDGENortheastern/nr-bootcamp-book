# D12S1. Sequence and control flow

All computer languages use so-called **programming constructs**. In imperative coding, they are used to control the way the program runs.

The most recognized basic programming constructs:

- [Sequence](#sequence)
- [Selection](#selection)
- [Iteration](#iteration)

## Variables (recap)

Before moving on with the control flow, let us revise variables.
A variable is a named place in computer memory that can store values.
Python variable names follow strict rules:

- names can not start with a number
- names can not contain spaces, use _ instead
- names can not contain any of these symbols: `:'",<>/?|\!@#%^&*~-+`
- it's considered best practice ([PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names)) that names are lowercase with underscores
- you must not use Python built-in keywords like `list` and `str`
- avoid using the single characters `l` (lowercase letter el), `O` (uppercase letter oh) and `I` (uppercase letter eye) as they can be confused with `1` and `0`

## Data types revision

Python variables can be of the following data types:

| Name | Type | Description |
| :- | :- | -: |
| Integer  | int | Whole numbers, e.g., 32, 5, -20  |
| Float  | float | Numbers with a decimal point, e.g., 1.2, -3.2 |
| String  | str | Strings of characters, text, e.g., "hello" |
| Boolean  | bool | True or False |
| List  | list | Ordered collections of values, e.g., `[23,"hello",4.5]` |
| Dictionary  | dict | Unordered key-value pairs, e.g., `{name: "Alex", age: 21}` |
| Tuple  | tup | Unchangeable (immutable) collections, e.g., `(2,3)`|
| Set  | set | Collections of unique value, e.g., `{"a","b"}`|

## Sequence

A sequence construct tells the processor which statement to execute (run) next. By default, statements/instructions are executed in order they are written, and each instruction is executed once.

We can spot when Python code is written in sequence because the instructions are aligned to the left. **Python uses indentation as a part of its syntax.**

```python
num1 = int(input('Enter a number: \n'))
num2 = 10
result = num1 + num2
print(result)
```

## Selection

A selection construct executes only some instructions depending on a condition being met. Conditions are powered by Boolean expressions and comparisons.

In Python, you can use only `if... elif... else` and regular expressions for selection statements. Other languages also have a `case` command. SQL has a `case` command, but SQL is not an imperative language.

Selection statements use indentation.

```python
num1 = int(input('Enter a number: \n'))
if num1 > 5:
    print("It is a large number")
else:
    print("It is a small number")
```

To understand how Booleans and selection are related, remind yourself what `num1>5` evaluates to.

An `elif` allows for extra conditions to be checked:

```python
num1 = int(input('Enter a number: \n'))
if num1 < 5:
    print("It is a small number")
elif num1 < 10:
    print("It is a medium number")
else:
    print("It is a large number")
```

Notice the order of conditions being checked above. Why do you think it is important to check that `num1 < 5` first?

## Iteration

Iteration is a programming construct used to execute the statements repeatedly, more than once.

Iteration also uses indentation.

The two most common iteration commands are `for` and `while`.

A `for loop` runs a set number of times, and a `while loop` runs until a condition is met.

The `for loop` below will print numbers from 1 to 10. Try to figure out how it works.

```python
for i in range(1,11):
    print(i)
```

The `while loop` below is the basic Guess My Number game.

```python
import random
my_number = random.randint(1,5) # picks a random number from 1 to 5
guess = 0
while guess != my_number:
    print("Keep guessing!")
    guess = int(input("Guess my number"))
print("You guessed it!")
```

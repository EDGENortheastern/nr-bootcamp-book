# D28S1. Data Modelling and Normalisation

Data Modelling is analyzing the data objects and their relationship to the other objects. In database design, the primary outcome of the data modeling process is the final entity-relationship diagram, ERD.

## ER diagrams

An Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a picture representing the structure of a database. It shows the relationships of entity sets and how tables are linked via primary and secondary keys.

An ER model is typically drawn at up to three levels of abstraction:

- Conceptual ERD / Conceptual Data Model
- Logical ERD / Logical Data Model
- Physical ERD / Physical Data Model

## Conceptual models

Conceptual ERD models the business objects and some of the relationships between them. A conceptual model is developed to present an overall picture. It defines entities, NOT tables. "Many-to-many" relationships may existon a conceptual data model.

## Logical models

Logical ERD is a more detailed version of a Conceptual ERD. A logical ER model defines explicitly the column heading in each entity and introduces some linking entities. However, it still may have some "many-to-many." Although a logical data model is still independent of the actual database system in which the database will be created, you can still consider that if it affects the design.

## Physical models

Physical ERD represents the actual design blueprint of a relational database. A physical data model elaborates on the logical data model by assigning each column with type, length, nullable, etc. Since a physical ERD represents how data should be structured and related in a specific DBMS it is important to consider the convention and restriction of the actual database system in which the database will be created. Make sure the column types are supported by the DBMS and reserved words are not used in naming entities and columns.

## Normalization

Normalization is the process of converting a database design into a standard format.

The conversion is done via a set of so-called normal forms. A normal form is a standard for designing a database.

Normalization achieves the benefits of a relational database, such as eliminating inconsistencies, removing duplicate information, and improving performance.

The start of the normalization process involves reorganizing attributes and entities. An entity can be a single thing, person, place, or object. As the database develops entities become tables. Attributes are columns in the tables of the future database.

## Normal forms

There are three common normal forms:

- [First normal form](#first-normal-form)
- [Second normal form](#second-normal-form)
- [Third normal form](#third-normal-form)

Each normal form makes your database more robust and better designed.
There are a few other normal forms that come after the third. In a nutshell, the sixth normal form decomposes relations to irreducible components. You can not create any more tables if you reached the sixth normal form and data duplication is 0. However, database designers do not strive to reach the sixth normal form as too many tables slow performance.

### First normal form

The first normal form is the first stage of the normalization process.

The definition of the first form is that each set of columns must be uniquely identified.

The combination of all the columns for each row in each table must be unique. No table column can have tables as values and there should be no repeating groups.

A primary key is a field or column in a table that contains a value that is unique for each row in the table. primary keys help ensure the first normal form. It is used to uniquely identify each record in a database.

The primary key is also used to identify entities during the data modeling process. Some common examples of primary keys are customer numbers and student ID, but names are not good primary keys because they are not always unique.

Reaching the first normal form involves analyzing some columns and possibly adding primary keys. We need to ask ourselves for each column and each table, does the combination of old columns make a
unique row every single time?

### Second normal form

The second normal is the second stage of the normalization process.
The definition of the second normal form is that it must fulfill the requirements of the first normal form and also no attributes must be functionally dependent on the primary key.

### Third normal form

The third normal form must fulfill the requirements of the second normal form and should have no transitive functional dependency. This means that columns should not depend on each other.

An easier way of looking at the third normal form is: it must not have many-to-many relationship.

# D20S2. Hypothesis testing in spreadsheets

## T-Tests

A t-test is a type of inferential statistic that determines if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups.

It is not the best method of hypothesis testing but it is good for introducing the idea.

A t-test is mostly used when the data sets follow a normal distribution.

## T-Test Assumptions

One can use t-tests for hypothesis testing only in certain situations. In Data analysis the term assumption is often used to describe situations methods and tools can be used in.

T-Test Assumptions are:

1. The first assumption made regarding t-tests concerns the scale of measurement. The assumption for a t-test is that the scale of measurement applied to the data collected follows a continuous or ordinal scale, such as the SATs score.
2. The second assumption made is that of a simple random sample, that the data is collected from a representative, randomly selected portion of the total population.
3. The third assumption is the data, when plotted, results in a normal distribution, bell-shaped distribution curve.
4. The final assumption is the homogeneity of variance, meaning that the standard deviations of samples are approximately equal.

## Tails of t-tests

A one-tailed test is a statistical hypothesis test set up to show that the sample mean would be higher or lower than the population mean, but not both.

In statistics, a two-tailed test is a method in which the critical area of a distribution is two-sided and tests whether a sample is greater or less than a range of values.

Google Sheets have a formula for t-testing:

```text
=TTEST(B7:B26,E7:E26,1,1)
```

The formula above will t-test ranges B and E with a one-tailed test.

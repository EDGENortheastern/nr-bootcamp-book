# D20S1. Hypothesis Testing

## Hypothesis

When you are making a decision, you need a yes or no answer. The correct approach is to use a test.
There are four steps in test-driven decision-making.
You must formulate a hypothesis
Find the right test for your hypothesis
Execute the test
Make a decision based on the result

What is a hypothesis?
There are many ways to define it, the most intuitive is: a hypothesis is an idea that can be tested.

This is not a formal definition, but it explains the point very well.

So if I tell you that properties in London are expensive, this is an idea or a statement but is not testable until we have something to compare prices with.

If we define expensive as any price higher than half a million dollars,
then it becomes a hypothesis.

What is something that cannot be a hypothesis?

An example may be what the USA does better or worse under a Biden administration compared to a Trump administration.

Statistically speaking, this is an idea, but there is no data to test it.
Therefore, it cannot be a hypothesis of a statistical test.

All right, let's get out of politics and get into hypotheses.

Two hypotheses are that are usually made are:

- the null hypothesis denoted H0
- the alternative hypothesis denoted H1 or Ha

The null hypothesis is the one to be tested and the alternative is absolutely everything else.

## Z-score

A Z-score is a numerical measurement that describes a value's relationship to the mean of a group of values.

Z-score is measured in terms of standard deviations from the mean. If a Z-score is 0, it indicates that the data point is identical to the mean score. A Z-score of 1.0 would indicate a value that is one standard deviation from the mean. Z-scores may be positive or negative, with a positive value indicating the score is above the mean and a negative score indicating it is below the mean.

## Hypothesis testing types

There are many types of tests. Hypothesis tests for samples drawn from a single population differ from ones drawn from multiple populations. We can run tests for a single mean with both known variance and unknown variance.

Two-sided tests are used when we are interested in knowing both the mean (if we are exploring the mean) being significantly less than or significantly more than the comparison value.

To use Z-score we need to know the capital Z-score. Z-score is the sample mean, minus the value from the null hypothesis, divided by the standard error. The standard error is the approximate standard deviation of a statistical sample population. We have not studied standardization yet so all standard values will be given. Lowercase z, which follows a standard normal distribution. To test a hypothesis with Z-score we compare z and Z.

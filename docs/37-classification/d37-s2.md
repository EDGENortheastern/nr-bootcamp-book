# D37S2. Random Forest and Support Vector Machines

## Random Forest

Random forest is a supervised Machine Learning algorithm that is used widely in classification and regression problems. It builds decision trees on different samples and takes their majority vote for classification and average in case of regression.

One of the most important features of the Random Forest Algorithm is that it can handle the data set containing continuous variables as in the case of regression and categorical variables as in the case of classification. It performs better results for classification problems.

Random forest uses a concept called ensemble learning.

Ensemble learning is when you take multiple machine learning algorithms and put them together to create one bigger machine learning algorithm so that the final machine learning algorithm is using many different other machine learning algorithms.
They can be the same machine learning algorithm (a decision tree for example).
We are going to be looking at the random forest method which combines a lot of decision tree methods.

## Support Vector Machine

Support Vector Machine or SVM is a supervised learning algorithm, that can be used for both classification and regression problems. However,  mostly it is used for classification problems. It is a highly efficient and preferred algorithm due to significant accuracy with less computation power.

In the SVM algorithm, we plot each observation as a point in an n-dimensional space (where n is the number of features in the dataset). Our task is to find an optimal hyperplane that successfully classifies the data points into their respective classes.

# D37S3. ML Model Optimisation

## Model Optimisation

Optimization is the process where we train the model iteratively resulting in a maximum and minimum evaluation. It is one of the most important phenomena in Machine Learning, optimization allows to get better results.

Why do we optimize our machine learning models? We compare the results in every iteration by changing the parameters in each step until we reach the optimum results. We create an accurate model with less error rate. There are different ways we can use to optimize a model.

The most common type of optimization problem encountered in machine learning is continuous function optimization, where the input arguments to the function are real-valued numeric values, e.g. floating-point values. The output from the function is also a real-valued evaluation of the input values.

We will consider the first steps towards understanding model optimization by looking at a KNN classifier and manually adjusting the model.

## Accuracy and confusion matrix

We have seen that you can use accuracy, the fraction of correctly classified samples, to measure model performance. However, accuracy is not always a useful metric. Consider a spam classification problem in which 99% of emails are real and only 1% are spam. I could build a model that classifies all emails as real; this model would be correct 99% of the time and thus have an accuracy of 99%, which sounds great. However, this naive classifier does a horrible job of predicting spam: it never predicts spam at all, so it completely fails at its original purpose. The situation when one class is more frequent is called class imbalance because the class of real emails contains way more instances than the class of spam. This is a very common situation in practice and requires a more nuanced metric to assess the performance of our model.

Given a binary classifier, such as our spam email example, we can draw up a 2-by-2 matrix that summarizes predictive performance called a confusion matrix.

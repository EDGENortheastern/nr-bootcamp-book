# D32S2. Date/Time data

Most languages process Date/Time data in a special way and have dedicated data types.

## SQL date and time functions

BigQuery supports many `DATE`, `TIME`, `DATETIME` AND `TIMESTAMP` functions.

### BigQuery `DATE`

To show the current date run:

```sql
SELECT CURRENT_DATE() AS the_date;
```

To get oonly the day from a day run:

```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(DAY FROM DATE '2013-12-25') AS the_day;
```

Can you figure out how to extract a year? a month? Try them in BigQuery.

To add 5 days to a date run:

```sql
SELECT DATE_ADD(DATE "2008-12-25", INTERVAL 5 DAY) AS five_days_later;
```

Figure out the date in 10 days from today. Use BigQuery.

To subtract an interval in days run:

```sql
SELECT DATE_SUB(DATE "2008-12-25", INTERVAL 5 DAY) AS five_days_ago;
```

`DATE_DIFF(date_expression_a, date_expression_b, date_part)` returns the whole number of specified date_part intervals between two DATE objects (date_expression_a - date_expression_b). If the first DATE is earlier than the second one, the output is negative.

Example:

```sql
SELECT DATE_DIFF(DATE '2010-07-07', DATE '2008-12-25', DAY) AS days_diff;
```

### BigQuery `TIME`

To show current **time**:

```sql
SELECT CURRENT_TIME() as now;
```

`FORMAT_TIME(format_string, time_object)` formats a TIME object according to the specified format string specification. See [Supported Format Elements For TIME](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/format-elements#format_elements_date_time) for a list of format elements that this function supports.

Example:

```sql
SELECT FORMAT_TIME("%R", TIME "15:30:00") as formatted_time;
```

The query above will return "15:30".

Time data aslo has `ADD`, `SUB`, `DIFF` and `EXTRACT` commands. Read the docs to find out more.

### BigQuery `TIMESTAMP`

The TIMESTAMP data type is used for values that contain both date and time parts. `TIMESTAMP` value can include a trailing fractional seconds part in up to microseconds (6 digits) precision. The TIMESTAMP data may contain timezone information.

### BigQuery `DATETIME`

`DATETIME` is used for values that contain both date and time parts. SQL retrieves and displays `DATETIME` values in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` format. The supported range is less than the one of a `TIMESTAMP`.

## Try the following BigQuery queries and figure what they do

1. Using `bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_trips` public data set

```sql
SELECT
  CURRENT_DATE() AS current_date,
  CURRENT_TIME() AS current_time,
  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() AS current_time_stamp,
  CURRENT_DATETIME() AS current_date_time,
  starttime,
  cast(starttime as date) as start_date,
  DATETIME_ADD(starttime, INTERVAL 5 DAY) AS five_days_later_from_start_time,
  DATETIME_DIFF(stoptime, starttime,  MINUTE) as tripduration_minutes,
  DATETIME_DIFF(stoptime, starttime,  SECOND) as tripduration_seconds,
  DATETIME_DIFF(stoptime, starttime,  HOUR) as tripduration_hours,
  date_diff(current_date(), cast(stoptime as date), DAY) as days_from_stop_to_current_date
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike.citibike_trips`
LIMIT
  1000;
```

1. Using `CAST` to switch between data types in SQL

```sql
SELECT
  CAST('2017-06-04 14:44:00' AS DATETIME) AS datetime,
  CAST('2017-06-04 14:44:00 Europe/Berlin' AS TIMESTAMP) AS timestamp,
  CAST('2017-06-04' AS DATE) AS date,
  CAST( '14:44:00' as TIME) time
```

## Date and time data in Python and Pandas

The approach to date and time variables in Python and Pandas is not dissimilar to the one in SQL. Find out more in this notebook:

## Big query tasks

1. Consider the data set `bigquery-public-data.new_york.nypd_mv_collisions`.

Write a query that queries the last 10 years of data (from today's current timestamp) and calculates the number of accidents per borough. Use the timestamp column in the data set to filter on.

1. Consider the data set `bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire`.

Write a query to do the following: By date (YYYY-MM-DD), calculate the total number of trips, the total minutes driven, and the average trip duration in minutes. Do not use the column duration in any calculation (that would be too easy). Calculate the trip duration on your own using end_date and start_date.

1. After you have the query, try making a time series graph in Deepnote.

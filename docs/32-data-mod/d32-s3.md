# D32S3. Visualizing different types of data

This is a mini-project area.

We have been discussing different ways of visualising data for a few sessions now.

Data visualisation is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs and maps, data visualisation tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers and patterns in data.

## Choose the right plot

To succeed in data visualization, you need to choose [the right plot](https://www.data-to-viz.com/) and tools.

## Choose the right tool

You can choose from at least three different visualisation libraries:

- Matlotlib
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Plotly

## Big query tasks

1. Consider the data set `bigquery-public-data.new_york.nypd_mv_collisions`.

Write a query that queries the last 10 years of data (from today's current timestamp) and calculates the number of accidents per borough. Use the timestamp column in the data set to filter on.

1. Consider the data set `bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire`.

Write a query to do the following: By date (YYYY-MM-DD), calculate the total number of trips, the total minutes driven, and the average trip duration in minutes. Do not use the column duration in any calculation (that would be too easy). Calculate the trip duration on your own using end_date and start_date.

1. After you have run the queries, try making appropriate graphs in Deepnotes.

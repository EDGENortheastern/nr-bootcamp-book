# D32S1. Python Task Automation

## Task automation

Task automation refers to the use of software to complete work activities. Task automation improves the accuracy and consistency of workflows, and powers work efficiency. Most importantly, task automation streamlines manual processes and minimizes the amount of labor required to produce the result.

## The Three Immutable Laws of Automation

1. Any task that is talked about being automated, will eventually be automated.
2. If it isn't automated it is broken.
3. If a human is doing it, a machine eventually will do it better.

## Python automation tools

You can program Python programs that do batch automation of different operations that take days to do manually.

You can create programs that send emails and SMS messages in batches, access the browser automatically get data from websites at set times, e.g., at midnight every day.

Python can send emails to hundreds of email contacts, attaching files for each email, all with a click of a button in your script.

Python can generate and convert PDF files, work with APIs, build chatbots, and many more.

Literally everything can be automated with Python.

Writing effective task-automation scripts is a big part of the role of a security professional, and Python is leading the way with its wide range of libraries and straightforward syntax. Python‚Äôs automation tools are not only saving time but also reducing errors in the field of cybersecurity.

To sum up, a non-exhaustive list of tasks that can be automated with Python is below:

- Sending out, replying to, and sorting emails
- Filling out PDFs and Excel files
- Sending HTTP requests
- Converting between file formats
- Performing quick math equations
- Calculating exchange rates
- Scraping data from web pages and saving it on the hard drive
- Getting/outputting data at certain times

### Python Scripts

A Python script is a file that you intend to execute to accomplish a task.

Python scripts normally are files with the extension `.py`

However, can be assigned to variables in iPython and look like strings.

There are different ways with which we can run a Python script.

- Python repl
- Command Line
- Text Editor ([VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- IDE ([PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/))
- iPython shell

## Deepnote iPython task

The first step to understanding how Python scripts work is to understand the basic command-line commands. You will see them in the Deepnote below:

Duplicate the Deepnote below, run or re-run the cells and try the tasks (signposted üèãÔ∏è).

# D38S3. ML Recap

## Machine Learning Portfolio Project

Use [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or `sklearn.datasets` to find a Machine Learning dataset.

Clean the data, scale features and use an appropriae ML model to obtain results.

To make your life easier search Kaggle for a specific dataset, e.g., classification.

The Iris dataset can be obtained as below:

```python
from sklearn import datasets
iris = datasets.load_iris()
```

## Publishing Deepnotes on GitHub instructions

Step 1. Create an empty GitHub repository. Do not even put a README into it.

Step 2. Open the terminal from your Deepnote. Run the following command:

```bash
git init
```

Step 3. Add a remote origin, e.g.,:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/missKatiaPunter/graces_
and_johns.git
```

Step 4. Add your Python to staging on git:

```bash
git add .
```

Step 5. Commit your Python to git, e.g.,:

```bash
git commit -m "Adds the chart"
```

Step 6. Git push or something like:

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin master
```

Step 7. Log in with your GitHub. You may need to first set up an Access token on GitHub. Go to Settings, find the section Developer Settings and follow the steps.

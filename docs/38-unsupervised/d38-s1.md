# D38S1. Unsupervised Learning, Clustering

## Unsupervised learning

Supervised learning is when we train the machine learning model using data that is labeled.

The two classic examples of supervised learning tasks are:

- classification
- regression

Unsupervised learning means you’re only exposing a machine to input data. There is no corresponding output data to teach the system the answers it should be arriving at.

Unsupervised Learning is a machine learning technique in which the users do not need to supervise the model. Instead, it allows the model to work on its own to discover patterns and information that was previously undetected. It mainly deals with the unlabelled data.

Unsupervised Learning Algorithms allow users to perform more complex processing tasks compared to supervised learning. On the other hand, unsupervised learning can be more unpredictable compared with other natural learning methods. Unsupervised learning algorithms include:

- [clustering](#clustering)
- [association rules mining](#association-rules-mining)
- [anomaly detection](#anomaly-detection)
- [unsupervised neural networks](#unsupervised-neural-networks)

## Clustering

Clustering is an important concept when it comes to unsupervised learning. It mainly deals with finding a structure or pattern in a collection of uncategorized data.

Unsupervised Learning clustering algorithms process the data and find natural clusters if they exist in the data. "Clusters" simply means "groups." You can modify how many clusters your algorithm needs to identify. The number of clusters parameter allows you to adjust the granularity of these groups.

## Association rules mining

Association rule is unsupervised learning where algorithm tries to learn without a teacher as data are not labelled.

Association rule is **descriptive** not the predictive method, generally used to discover interesting relationship hidden in large datasets.

The relationship are usually represented in form of rules or frequent itemsets.

Association rules mining are used to identify new and interesting insights between different objects in a set, frequent pattern in transactional data or any sort of relational database. They are commonly used for Market Basket Analysis (which items are bought together), Customer clustering in Retail (Which stores people tend to visit together), Price Bundling, Assortment Decisions, Cross Selling and others. This can be considered advanced form of what if scenario, if this then that.

## Anomaly Detection

Anomaly is a synonym for the word ‘outlier’. Anomaly detection (or outlier detection) is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data. Anomalous activities can be linked to some kind of problems or rare events such as bank fraud, medical problems, structural defects, malfunctioning equipment etc.

Fraudulent activities in banking systems, fake ids and spammers on social media and DDoS attacks on small businesses have the potential to collapse the respective organizations and this can only be prevented if there are ways to detect such malicious (anomalous) activity. Since there are tonnes of ways to induce a particular cyber-attack, it is very difficult to have information about all these attacks beforehand in a dataset. But, since the majority of the user activity online is normal, we can capture almost all the ways which indicate normal behaviour. And from the inclusion-exclusion principle, if an activity under scrutiny does not give indications of normal activity, we can predict with high confidence that the given activity is anomalous.

## Unsupervised Neural Networks

Unsupervised neural networks are particularly useful in areas like digital art, fraud detection and cybersecurity.

[ThreatWarrior](https://threatwarrior.com/) is the first solution to use unsupervised neural networks for cyber defense. [Watch their promo here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbS2bYEsWuU).

By learning what’s ‘normal’ for a network, ThreatWarrior learns what is abnormal. If there is activity or behaviors that fall outside the learned pattern, ThreatWarrior will alert to these anomalies.

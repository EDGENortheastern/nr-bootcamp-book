# D17S1. Principles of Probability

## Probability definition

Probability is the chance of something happening. In more academic words it would be the likelihood of an event occurring.

When talking about probabilities, an event is a specific outcome or a combination of outcomes. These outcomes can be anything, e.g., getting tails when flipping a coin.

## Binomial trials

If you flip a coin there are two possible outcomes: heads or tails. This type of experiment is called a [Bernoulli trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_trial) or a binomial trial.

> A binomial trial is an experiment with exactly two outcomes: "success" and "failure."

In Bernoulli/binomial trials the ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù is the result you are looking for. If you want "tails" - then the "success" is getting tails. If you want "heads" - then the "success" is getting heads. It could be a "strongly agree" in a survey, a piece of code that works (as opposed to one that doesn't).

## Expressing probabilities numerically

We express probabilities numerically.

It is possible to express probabilities as percentages or proper fractions. However, conventionally, we write them using decimal fractions between zero and one. Instead of using 20 percent or one-fifth (1/5), we write 0.2.

Having a probability of one expresses absolute certainty of the event occurring.
The probability of zero expresses the absolute certainty of the event not occurring.

Higher probability values indicate a higher likelihood.

## Calculating Probability

We measure Probability with numeric values between 0 and 1. One of the main reasons for that is the frequent need to **compare** the relative likelihoods of events.

The general probability formula is below.

P(X)= Preferred Outcomes / Sample Space

The Probability of the event X occurring is: the number of preferred outcomes divided by the number of outcomes in the sample space.

Preferred or favorable outcomes are what we want to happen, the result we are interested in. For example, if we are playing "Rock, Paper, Scissors" and we are holding scissors, the preferred outcome is one.

Sample space refers to all possible outcomes, in the case of a single game of "Rock, Paper, Scissors" it is three.

So, the probability of winning "Rock, Paper, Scissors" is `1 / 3`. The result has to be a decimal fraction, i.e., `0.333333333` or `0.3(3)`.

`0.333333333` is a recurring decimal, it has a repeated digit or section of repeated digits after a decimal point. Such decimals can be written as `0.n(n)` where `n` is a recurring segment.

## Solving probability challenges

### Task 1

What is the probability of drawing a spade (‚ô†Ô∏è) from a standard deck of playing cards? A standard deck consists of 52 playing cards, 13 of which are spades.

P(‚ô†Ô∏è) = 13 / 52 = 0.25

### Task 2: üé≤

Imagine you have a single standard six-sided die. You want to roll a four.
You have a single preferred outcome (4) but six total possible outcomes.

P(4) = 1 / 6 = 0.16(6)

The repeating digit in the solution above is 6. We can round the above probability up:

P(4) = 1 / 6 ~ 0.167

### Task 3: üé≤

Events can be more complex. For example, what is the probability of rolling a number divisible by three on a single standard six-sided die?
Let us list all numbers on a single standard six-sided die: 1,2,3,4,5,6.
We need to roll either a three or a six, to get a number divisible by three.

The total number of possible outcomes stays the same since the die still has six sides. However, the number of preferred outcomes is now 2:

3
6.

P(x%3==0) = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3 = 0.3(3) ~ 0.33

### Task 4: üé≤

For mutually exclusive events probability of event A OR event B occurring can be seen as probability of event A plus probability of event B.

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)

For exmple, if we want to roll either 1 or 5 on a single standard six-sided die we can calculate it this way:

P(1) = 1 / 6
P(5) = 1 / 6

P(1 or 5) = 1 / 6 + 1 / 6 = 2 / 6 = 1 / 3 = = 0.3(3) ~ 0.33

### Task 5: ‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô£Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô†Ô∏è

For independent events, that are not linked or mutually exclusive, the probability of event A AND event B occurring can be calcculated as probability of event A **times** probability of event B.

P(AandB)=P(A)√óP(B)

For example, what is the likelihood of getting the ace of spades from a standard deck? A standard deck of cards consists of 52 playing cards, 13 of which are spades and 4 are aces. We should calculate the probability of getting an ace and the probability of getting a spade. The we need to **multiply the results**.

P(A) = 4 / 52 = 0.07692307692 ~ 0.077
P(‚ô†Ô∏è) = 13 / 52 = 0.25

P(A of ‚ô†Ô∏è) = 0.077 * 0.25 = 0.01925

Of course, we could have found it more easily with:

P(A of ‚ô†Ô∏è) = 1 / 52 ~ 0.019

However, the answer is the same.

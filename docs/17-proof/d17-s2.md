# D17S2. Probability Modelling in spreadsheets

The formulas for probability we explored earlier were formulas for the so-called true or theoretical probability. They are great. However, in real life, we do not always know the true probability. We infer probability from running experiments.

## Experiments

Imagine we **don't know** the probability of getting heads when flipping a coin.

We can estimate it ourselves. We toss a coin several times. After doing one flip and recording the outcome, we complete **a trial.** By completing multiple trials, we are conducting an experiment. If we toss a coin 20 times and record the 20 outcomes, that entire process is a single experiment with 20 trials.

The probabilities we get after conducting experiments are called **experimental probabilities.**

When we are uncertain what the true probabilities are or how to compute them, we conduct experiments. The experimental probabilities we get are not equal to the true ones but are a good approximation.

The formula we use to calculate experimental probabilities is similar to the formula applied for the theoretical ones earlier. It is simply the number of successful trials divided by the total number of trials.

P(X) = the number of successful trials/the total number of trials

## Distribution

In statistics, when we use the term distribution,
we usually mean a probability distribution. Some distribution examples are:

- the Normal distribution
- the Binomial distribution
- the Uniform distribution.

A distribution is a function that shows the possible values for a variable and how often they occur.

Think about a fair die. It has six sides, numbered from 1 to 6. We
roll the die. What is the probability of getting 1? It is one out of six, so one-sixth.

What is the probability of getting 2? Once again - one-sixth.

The same holds for 3, 4, 5, and 6.

What is the probability of getting a 7? It is impossible to get a 7 when rolling a single die. Therefore, the probability is 0.

Thatâ€™s the probability distribution of rolling a die. By the way, it is called a discrete uniform distribution.

All outcomes have an equal chance of occurring.

We can represent distributions with bar charts and frequency tables.

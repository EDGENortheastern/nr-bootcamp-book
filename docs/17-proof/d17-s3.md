# D17S3. Probability Modelling in Pandas

## Probability mass and distribution functions

In random experiments some outcomes are more likely than others. This is called a probability distribution. One of the most astounding phenomena of probability distribution is [Benford's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law). And it is even on Netflix.

The two most important functions for calculating probability are:

- the probability mass function
- the cumulative distribution function.

## The probability mass function

The probability mass function (pmf) allows you to calculate the probability of getting a particular outcome for a discrete random variable. The formula is massive, but Python has a module and method.

For example, it allows you to calculate the probability of getting k heads from n coin flips with p probability of getting heads.

```python
# Probability of 2 heads after 10 throws with a fair coin
binom.pmf(k=2, n=10, p=0.5)
```

## Probability distribution function (cdf)

If you instead want to calculate the probability of getting k or fewer heads from n throws, you use the binomial probability distribution function, which adds the probabilities of getting 0 heads out of n flips or getting heads once out of n flips
and getting all the way up to k heads out of n flips.

```python
# Probability of 5 heads or less after 10 throws with a fair coin
binom.cdf(k=5, n=10, p=0.5)
```

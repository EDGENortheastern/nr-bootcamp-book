# D8S4. Primary and foreign keys

## Primary key

A database table typically has a column or combination of columns that contain values that uniquely identify each row in the table.

This column, or columns, is called the Primary Key (PK) of the table and enforces the entity integrity of the table.

In SQLite, a primary key constraint guarantees uniqueness of data.


```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS breeds (
  breedid INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  breedname VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  descriptionbreed TEXT
);
```

## Foreign key

A foreign key (FK) is a column or combination of columns that is used to establish and enforce a link between the data in two tables.

In a foreign key reference, a link is created between two tables when the column or columns that hold the primary key value for one table are referenced by the column or columns in another table. This column becomes a foreign key in the second table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS breeds (
  breedid INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  breedname VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  descriptionbreed TEXT
);
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS dogs (
  dogid INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  dogname VARCHAR(100),
  is_healthy INTEGER(1) DEFAULT 1,
  health_issues TEXT DEFAULT "--blank--",
  breedid INTEGER,
  FOREIGN KEY (breedid) REFERENCES breeds(breedid) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

## JOINS

A `JOIN` clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

```sql
SELECT
  dogs.dogname,
  breeds.breedname
FROM
  dogs
INNER JOIN
  breeds
ON
  dogs.breedid = breeds.breedid;
```

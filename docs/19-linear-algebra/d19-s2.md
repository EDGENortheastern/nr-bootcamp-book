# D19S2. Matrix manipulation in spreadsheets

In this session we are going to look at two important functions in Google Sheets - ARRAYFORMULA() and MMULT().

The Array Formula function allows us to run the same operation on a row, column or range. 

The Matrix Multiplication function allows us to multiply a range by another range.

Lets recap.

The mathematical term for a single item is a **scalar**. It's a single thing that can be measured.

|   |
|---|
| 1 |

A vertical range is a **column**.

|   |
|---|
| 1 | 
| 2 | 
| 3 |

A horizontal range is a **row**.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2 | 3 |

These two things are called a **vectors** in mathematical terms.

A matrix fleshes this out into two dimensional space.


|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 2 | 3 | 4 |
| 3 | 4 | 5 |

Array Formula expands our capabilities to manipulate Matrices.
In many cases, it just accomplishes what we can do by dragging down formula.

The following formula multiplies a range by three.

```text
=ARRAYFORMULA(A1:C3*3)
```
For example, if the above matrix is in the range A1:C3, we would get the following result.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | 6 | 9 |
| 6 | 9 | 12 |
| 9 | 12 | 15 |

ArrayFormulas can be used for many things, but this is a simple use case that should introduce you to them.

Matrix Multiplication is slightly more complicated, and needs its own formula.

With a 1x3 column and a 3x1 it is pretty simple, and works as we would expect.

|   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
|  **1** | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|  **2** | 2 | 4 | 6 |
|  **3** | 3 | 6 | 9 |

However, what if we want to work with bigger matrixes?

## Tensors

We have oriented ourselves to what Linear Algebra is in general and how important it is for linear regression analysis, one of the simplest and most common ways to make predictions.

However, Linear Algebra is also one of the fundamental building blocks of Machine Learning.

Linear algebra studies linear transforms applied to vectors and matrices.
Tensors are a generic term for data structures used in machine learning and Linear Algebra. Tensors are the fundamental building blocks of Linear Algebra for absolutely any kind of machine learning.

What are Tensors as in Tensor Flow, the most famous deep learning platform from Google?

You might be surprised that it is shockingly simple.

Tensors are a machine learning-specific generalization of vectors and matrices to any number of dimensions. I can make it even simpler. Tensors are arrays. To be more precise there are the following types of tensors:
a zero-dimensional Tensor is a scalar, so just a single value, a variable.
vectors are linear arrays in one dimension of values
a matrix is a two-dimensional array
a three-dimensional Tensor does not have an old-school name, it is a 3-Tensor.

And the idea of a Tensor is to generalize these kinds of objects to any number of dimensions. Tensors can be in any number of dimensions. Yeah, probably in Tensor flow there are 12-Tensors... The computer deals with them, so you do not have to even imagine a 12-Tensor.

# D19S1. Linear Algebra

## Algebra definition

To define linear algebra it is good to discuss first what **Algebra** more generally is.

Algebra is arithmetic that includes operations on non-numerical entities like x and y. x and y are abstractions just like variables in code. They help solve mathematical problems. Let us exemplify how an x can help us solve a basic equation:

```text
3*x + 6 = 18
3*x = 18-6
3*x = 12
x=12/3
x=4
```

And you can confirm for yourself that x must be equal to four because you can plug it into the original equation: 3*4+6 is indeed 18.

## Linear Algebra definition

So that is what Algebra is. To explain what Linear Algebra is let us discuss what Linear Algebra is not.

It is not linear algebra if it has an exponential term. For example, an equation that has x squared plus five isn't linear. It is a nonlinear transformation and a square root is needed:

<var>x<sup>2</sup></var> + 5 = 30 ‚ùó This is not Linear Algebra

## Linear Algebra and Linear Regression

Linear regression is a method for modeling the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable. As you can figure out from the name, linear regression is based on linear relationships studied in Linear Algebra. In simpler words, if we plot the graphs of those relationships they will be lines.

## Regression analysis

Regression analysis is arguably the most common method of prediction.
It is used whenever we have a causal relationship between variables.

A good starting point to see explore the relationship between 2 variables is the correlation coefficient. It is a value between 0 and 1 and the closer to 1 it is the more correlated the variables are.

In Google sheets to find the correlation coefficient between columns B and C (starting in the fifth row) we can use the formula:

```text
=CORREL(B5:B,C5:C)
```

Correlation measures the degree of relationship between two variables regression analysis is about how one variable affects another or what changes it causes to the other.

Correlation doesn't capture causality, but the degree of interrelation between the two variables regression is based on causality.

It shows no degree of connection but cause and effect.

The two methods have very different graphical representations, linear regression analysis is the best fitting line that goes through the data points and minimizes the distance between them, while correlation is a single point.

A linear regression line has an equation of the form y = a + b*x, where x is the independent variable and y is the dependent variable. The slope of the line is b, and a is the intercept (the value of y when x = 0).

Let us the trend line in Google Sheets to see some linear regression.

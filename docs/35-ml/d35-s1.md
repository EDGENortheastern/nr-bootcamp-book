# D35S1. Introduction to Machine Learning

## Machine Learning - the definition

Machine learning is a field of Artificial Intelligence or AI.

AI, as the name suggests, studies the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior. Artificial intelligence systems perform complex tasks in a way that is similar to how humans solve problems.

The goal of machine learning is to program computers to use example data or past experience to solve a given problem.

Machine Learning (ML) is one of the biggest fields of Data Science. In fact, it has grown so quickly over the past decade that now you are almost expected to know some level of Machine Learning to call yourself a Data Scientist or even a Data Analyst.

## Examples of AI algorithms

Among the various components that are the foundation of Artificial Intelligence, Algorithms are at the top.

An algorithm a sequence of unambiguous instructions or specifications that are used to solve a problem, perform calculations, make decisions. Thhe entire field of Artificial Intelligence is based on a range of algorithms.

When we move on to actually practicing machine learning, we would often just import machine learning modules from, for example, [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

However, it is worse to look at at least one classic AI algorithm, [Minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax).

Minimax Algorithm is one of the algorithms used in decision making and game theory to find the most optimal move or solution.

You can watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trKjYdBASyQ) for a detailed explanaion of how Minimax works.

## Replit to play tic-tac-toe with AI

The replit below is just an example of what an AI algorithm can do. You do not have to code or even fully understand. Just play. But you do have to fork it first.

## Machine learning applications

Here are some famous applications of machine learning.

- Facebook's [facial recognition system](#facial-recognition-systems)
- Gesture devices such as [Xbox Kinect](#xbox-kinect)
- [Virtual reality headsets](#vr-headsets)
- [Speech to text or voice recognition](#speech-to-text-or-voice-recognition)
- [Google Translate](#google-translate)
- Amazon and Netflix recommendation systems
- Can you name some?

### Facial recognition systems

Everybody knows this when you upload a photo, Facebook somehow knows already who your friends are and tags them automatically. That is a machine learning algorithm in action. Can you think of other facial recognition systems?

### Xbox Kinect

There used to be an Xbox device called Kinect. It really didn't really lift off, but that was a marketing thing. However, it was a really cool device. It looked at your actions, you did not have to have a joystick and could play games on your Xbox with gestures.
Xbox Kinect used a machine learning algorithm called Random Forest, which we'll explore later in the week.

### VR headsets

Then there are the virtual reality headsets where you turn your head and the picture moves. How does the machine know what to do? That's a machine learning algorithm, monitoring your actions and connecting them to the game or whatever you are looking at.

### Speech to text or voice recognition

You often see a little button where you can do text to speech or text
to voice recognition. When you click that button, it recognizes what you are saying. That is also a machine learning algorithm in action.

### Google Translate

Did you know that [Google Translate](https://analyticsindiamag.com/google-translate-machine-learning/) is about 300 lines of code? Despite such a minimalist codebase it does an amazing job and gets better all the time.

## Presentation task

Spend some time to find you own examples of where machine learning is used and present to the class.

It would be a good idea to use [hackmd](https://hackmd.io/) and push it to GitHub.
